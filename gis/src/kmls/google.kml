The landscapes of Wales have been formed by natural processes and shaped by human activity. This human activity ranges from the prehistoric periods through to the modern age. To recognise the value of historic landscapes, and to raise awareness of their importance, Cadw, in partnership with the Countryside Council for Wales (now called Natural Resources Wales) and the International Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS UK) has compiled a non-statutory Register of 58 landscapes of outstanding or special historic interest in Wales. Information regarding Registered Landscapes and the use of the Registers can be found in: -

The Register of Historic Landscapes is a non-statutory, advisory register. Its primary aim is to provide information and raise awareness of an initial selection of the most important and significant historic landscape areas in Wales in order to aid their protection and conservation. This information is intended to help owners, Government, statutory bodies, Local Authorities, developers and all those who are involved with land management and protection to make better-informed decisions about areas on the Register. Planning Policy Wales sets out the general principles for the use of the Register in the planning process, stating that information on historic landscapes included in the Register should be taken into account by local planning authorities in preparing Local Development Plans, and in considering the implications of developments that are of such a scale that they would have more than local impact on an area on the Register. 


1.2 Frequency of Update

The dataset that is available on Lle has not required updating since the publication of the original Registers in 1998 and 2001. 

1.3 Depictions

The Historic Landscape Character areas were digitised from the original hardcopy depictions taken from Registers that were created in 1998 and 2001. Care should be taken when using this data. The following advice is described in ‘Guide to Good Practice on Using the Register of Landscapes of Historic Interest in Wales in the Planning and Development Process: Revised (2nd) Edition including Revisions to the Assessment Process (ASIDOL2)’

‘7.3 A pragmatic and common sense approach was adopted for determining the broad extents of the landscape areas on the Register. The methodology is explained in detail in the introduction to the Register (Part 2.2, pp. xxx-xxxi, ‘Defining the areas’). In summary, the nature of the historic interest concerned determined the extent of the landscape areas on the Register and, in many cases, because of Wales’s varied topography, the landscape areas coincided with the physical limits of natural features like mountains, valleys, basins, promontories and so on.

(Cadw, 2007, 13)

In parallel with the Register, ‘Historic Landscape Characterisation’ has provided more detailed information about each area on the Register. This characterisation work was undertaken by the four Welsh Archaeological Trusts.  Further information regarding the Welsh Archaeological Trust defined Historic Landscape Characterisation Areas can be found on the Welsh Archaeological Trust’s websites.

The primary purpose of characterisation is to inform landscape conservation and management, and as the basis for the assessment of the significance of the impact of development on the historic landscape (ASIDOHL2). The Guide to Good Practice on Using the Register of Landscapes of Historic Interest in the Planning and Development Process, provides clarity about the relationship between the Register itself, and the historic character areas identified through characterisation. The Guide to Good practice addresses the question of landscape edges as follows:  A pragmatic and common sense approach was adopted for determining the broad extents of the landscape area on the Register (Section 7.3). By their very nature and much smaller scale, the edges of Historic Character areas will be drawn to coincide with the geographical or physical limits of their characteristics, and in most cases have produced precise edges that can be shown as hard lines on maps. These should not be taken as representing the edges of the landscape areas on the Register (Section 7.4). In some cases, Historic Character Area edges can fall outside the extent of the landscape areas on the Register. In planning terms, the Register is non-statutory, and so is the information from characterisation that is intended to support it. It will be a matter for the planning or other competent authority undertaking an Environmental Impact Assessment, or the PIanning Inspector concerned, to determine where a precise edge should be drawn. All the evidence in the Register, the relevant characterisation report and any subsequent work should be carefully considered and weighed against the nature and extent of the proposed development and its predicted impact on the landscape area on the Register. The guiding principle is that where drawn edges are required, they should be as consistent as possible with the maintenance of those historic elements or characteristics that demonstrate the outstanding or special interest of the landscape area on the Register.  Thus, although the edges established through characterisation do not technically become the boundaries of the Registered area (the maps of which are locational rather than definitive), in practice, and in order to comply with the guiding principle outlined above, it seems reasonable to refer to characterisation boundaries when providing advice relating to historic landscapes, and to the extent of an ASIDOHL2. Ultimately, it will be for the Planning Authority or a Planning Inspector to determine where the boundary should be drawn in any particular case, but as advisors, Cadw refers to the most detailed information on historic landscape character, field-tested in the characterisation process. Any advice should clearly explain where the landscape edges do not coincide, to enable the competent authority to reach its own view.

Historic Landscape Character areas encompass large spatial areas and these areas can contain other protected monuments, buildings and parks and gardens etc.

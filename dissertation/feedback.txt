The intro might make the context a little clearer, 
I suspect someone unfamiliar with your project might be a bit confused about what you are 
trying to do with the sentiment analysis. 
## DONE

One part which isn’t really covered is the reviews themselves, 
we’ve sometimes mentioned just using a score, 
but you also discuss using text. 
In terms of presentation, you should differentiate the aim and objectives. 
Some of the citations might be incorporated a little more smoothly (ask me for examples), 
but most of the writing is good and you have made good use of references to support 
your discussion. 

Some of the later sections in particular would benefit from proof reading 
and more attention to detail for a more professional look.

The literature review itself is thorough, with references used well, 
and you’ve done a good job of evaluating the techniques although some of the conclusions 
are a bit vague and I don’t really follow how they would work in practice for your project. 
You might give clearer examples to help the reader. 

The software discussion is good, but needs a conclusion.

I’m not sure what Chapter 3 is meant to be, it appears to belong in the Lit Review still.

The LSEPI could also be tidied in places but covers the important parts.
Overall this has some good content and you are well set for the project to start some 
experiments, but the document itself can be refined a bit for the final version.

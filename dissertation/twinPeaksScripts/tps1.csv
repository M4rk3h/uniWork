s1e1, Gone fishing. The lonesome foghorn blows. Oh  dear. Lucy? Lucy  this is Pete Martell. Lucy  put Harry on the horn. Sheriff  it's Pete Martell up at the mill. Um  I'm gonna transfer it to the phone on the table by the red chair. The red chair against the wall. The little table with the lamp on it. The lamp that we moved from the corner. The black phone  not the brown phone. Morning  Pete. Harry. She's dead. Wrapped in plastic. Whoa  hold on. Hold on a second  Pete. Where? You stay right there. I'm on my way. You better get Dr. Hayward. Tell him to meet me up at the Packard Mill  the dock right below the dam. And roust that Andy out of bed  tell him to get his butt up there now. - What is it? - We got a body up there. Lucy  not a word about this to anyone until you hear from me. It's over here. You want forensics first? No  she's been in the water. We'd better take some pictures. - Who is she? - Andy  pictures. - Sorry. - Then we'll turn her over. Sure  okay. Oh  Andy. My God  Andy. Same thing as last year in Mr. Blodgett's barn. - Give me the camera  Andy. - Sorry. Is this gonna happen every damn time? I'm sorry. - I'm so sorry. - Okay. Okay. Why don't you go up to the coroner's van and bring back that stretcher? - Okay. - Okay. Sorry. Harry  let's roll her over. Good Lord. Laura. Laura Palmer. Laura. Laura  sweetheart  I'm not gonna tell you again. Yes  I am. Laura. Laura? Oh  for goodness sakes. Laura  now means now. Laura? Laura? Laura  honey  are you downstairs? - Hello? - Bett  it's Sarah. Listen  I just went up to wake Laura and she's not here. - Is she with Bobby? - Well  she could be. He leaves every morning to go running and then he goes to football practice. Can you  um  find out? Can you reach him? I'll call the school. Just a minute  I've got the number of the field office here. Thanks. Thanks  Bett. You know  I'm wondering if maybe she went out with Leland. He had an early meeting. Oh  I'm sure that's it. Either that or she's with Bobby. Sure. I'll call up to the hotel  thanks. Hmm. No  Bobby hasn't showed up for practice yet today. And come to think of it  as a matter of fact  he's been late every day this week  Mrs. Palmer. And last week. And maybe even the week before. - Are they ready to sign? - You're not gonna mention that we have not as yet acquired access to the Packard land? Sorry. We have solid information that the Packard Sawmill is gonna go belly-up within a year. We're gonna be able to get it for a song. One verse  no chorus. Now  let's get out there and get those cheese-eaters where they live. Ahh  Benjamin Clean  wholesome environment  much like your very own. With a quality of life to rival the very best that this country has to offer. And that is what the Ghostwood Country Club and Estates will be. Now  when I first spoke to Sven  he was naturally very concerned about the quality of air here. If you'll permit me  Sven  to repeat what you told me this morning after your run: "My air sacs  ah  have never felt so good. " Your wife's on the phone again. She said it's urgent. Excuse me a moment  gentlemen. I'll be right back. Uh  make it snappy  huh? So here in Twin Peaks  health and industry go hand in hand. - I'll transfer you to the house phone. - Okay  thank you. Ahh. Sarah  what is it? - Is Laura with you? - No  why? She didn't go with you this morning? No  what? Honey  what's wrong? What's this all about? She's not here. She wasn't here this morning. Well  she's  um  probably with Bobby. I can't find Bobby. Well  there you are. That's it. Let's not worry. I mean  they're probably together. She would've left a note. Why didn't she? - She would've told me. - Honey  honey  take it easy  please. Excuse me. I'm looking for Leland Palmer. He's right over there on the phone. Sheriff Truman. What? Who? What did you say? Oh  my God. Oh  God. Laura. No. Laura. Oh  Leland  please  what is it? Tell me. Leland Is this about Laura? I'm afraid it is. Leland? Tell me. Oh. My baby. No! Oh  no! - No. - Okay? Leland  we're ready to go with the contracts. Leland? What's wrong? My daughter's dead. No! What kept you  Heidi? Seconds on knockwurst this morning? I couldn't get my car started. Too busy jump-starting the old man  huh? I thought you Germans were always on time. I thought the only time you cared about  Bobby  was making time. You heading out  Shelly? Yeah  I'm heading home. I'm going to practice. I can drop you by your place on the way if you want. That would be great  thanks. Here's a tune for you  gals. Okay. Norma. I'll see you in my dreams. Not if I see you first. Don't do anything I wouldn't do. I think she knows about us. - Norma? - Mm-hm. No. Fat chance. I think she's hot to trot for you herself. It's happy hour in France. Come on  cowboy  light your fire. Right. Just a little pick-me-up before home room? - I thought I was your little pick-me-up. - Ha  ha. Baby  you are more like a three-stage rocket. A pocket rocket. And what stage are we in now? Are you sure that your old man is still on the road? Yes  he called me last night from Butte. That's a long ways away and he ain't got a phone in his truck. So quit worrying and start scurrying  Mr. Touchdown. Butte. Back up. I'll call you later. Leland  I'm so sorry. Seventeen years old. Lee  I hate to put you through this. No  I have to see her. I have to see what was done to my little girl. Okay. My baby. It's my little girl. - God  God. - Let's get out of here. I can't Oh  God. - Have you seen Laura? - No  not yet. - Nice day for a picnic. - Uh  yeah. Bobby Briggs  they're looking for you. - Who is? - Sheriff is. Well  here I am in school. - Hey  Snake. - Hey  man  something's up. - Where? - Think I'm kidding? What  me worry? Bobby  you're wanted in the office. - Who wants me in the office? - Right now  young man. Watch out. - Terry Franklin? - Here. - Martha Grimes? - Here. - Donna Hayward? - Here. - Audrey Horne? - Here. - James Hurley? - Yo. Excuse me. Room 106? Mm-hm. Is there a Bobby Briggs in this classroom? No  um  he's in 107? 107. Could I speak to you for a moment  please? Certainly. - Um  there's a - Mm-hm. The principal will be making an announcement. Yes? Thank you for your time. Laura. There will be an announcement from the principal. I told you  I got up early like I always do. I went running like I always do. I went for some breakfast at the Double R and I didn't go to practice because I didn't feel like it. Why didn't you feel like it  Bobby? Were you upset about something? Something troubling you  Bobby? You wanna tell us about it? Look  you guys  please  what did I do? What's going on? Mr. Wolchezk  there's rumors all over school. Maybe it's best if they heard it from you. Mr. Wolchezk  why don't you go ahead and make that announcement? - Now? - Now's the time. Excuse me. What is it  sheriff? What's going on? Now  Bobby  you look at me. Your girlfriend  Laura Palmer's  been killed. She was found just after dawn. Now  she was with you last night and you weren't where you were supposed to be this morning. Have these fellas advised you of your rights? Yes  but I didn't know why. - Laura's dead? - Yes. Did you understand your rights as they were explained to you? You think I killed her? We're gonna have you make a phone call. You can call your parents and they can arrange to get a lawyer to be with you when we talk to you again. Andy  take Bobby out to make his call. I loved her. And she loved me. You think because I wasn't at football practice that I killed my girlfriend? You are crazy. You get off of me. Bobby  we're gonna talk about this later. May I have your attention  please? This is Principal Wolchezk. I am deeply saddened to have to tell you that early this morning your classmate Laura Palmer was found dead. This is a terrible moment for all of us. For all of us who knew her. Her friends  her family. It is very important that we all try to help each other through this difficult time. The police have asked me to ask each of you  if you have any information about Laura's activities after school yesterday or yesterday evening  please come forward. I am dismissing all classes for the day  but before we leave  I would like to ask each of you to join me in a moment of silence for Laura and her dear memory. Oh  God. You can talk to her now  Harry. Do you know what time it was when you last saw Laura  Mrs. Palmer? - What time? - Yes. Uh  it would have been about 9. Yes  9:00 p. m. She came home from Bobby's and she was going up the stairs. Those stairs right there. Who's upstairs? Your husband and one of my men. I can tell from the sounds that it isn't her. Her diary? Do you know where the key to this is  sir? - Do you have to take that? - We'll return it as soon as possible. Did she say anything to you? No. She said good night. And I said good Good night  sweetheart. Mrs. Palmer  can you remember  did she make or receive any phone calls? I heard her phone ring once. About what time was that? I don't know who it was. Harry. That was Lucy. Got a call from a guy that works up at the mill  Janek Pulaski. Says his daughter didn't come home last night. And she didn't show up at school today either. Two by fours  four by eights. Two by fours  four by Did you hear me? You can't do that to my workers. Don't walk away from me like that. Come on back here. You're not going anywhere and you're not gonna tell anybody anything. Katherine  I'm sorry if this offends you  but I am the owner of this sawmill. And you don't know the first thing about this mill. That's why I'm running it. I've never taken this authority before  but maybe I should have. You're not shutting us down. Katherine  I have the final say-so. Peter  push the plug. Pete  don't you dare. Katherine  please. Shorty  tell the boys to pull the plug. That's right. May I have your attention? This is Josie Packard. I've decided that today  in the light of what has happened  all work here will stop. Bitch. This morning  as you know  the body of Miss Laura Palmer What's your name? - Was found near our dock. - Fred Truax. You're fired. Just now your coworker and a friend  Mr. Janek Pulaski  has learned that his daughter  one of Laura's schoolmates  is missing since last night. Today  all work here will stop. The mill will shut down. Perhaps you can spend the day with your families. Thank you all for your attention. What the hell? Laura's dead. Yeah  I heard. She was the one. Buy you a coffee? Can't do it. If you see Donna  could you give this to her? You bet. Ed. Ed. They said those drapes would be ready by 10. Now  I want those drapes up by nightfall. Diane  11:30 a. m.   February 24th. Entering the town of Twin Peaks. It's five miles south of the Canadian border  twelve miles west of the state line. I've never seen so many trees in my life. As W. C. Fields would say  "I'd rather be here than Philadelphia. " Fifty-four degrees on a slightly overcast day. Weatherman said rain. If you could get paid that kind of money for being wrong 60 percent of the time  it'd beat working. Mileage is 79 345  gauge is on reserve. I'm riding on fumes here  I gotta tank up when I get into town. Remind me to tell you how much that is. Lunch was  uh  $6. 31 at the Lamplighter Inn. That's on Highway 2 near Lewis Fork. That was a tuna fish sandwich on whole wheat  slice of cherry pie and a cup of coffee. Damn good food. Diane  if you ever get up this way  that cherry pie is worth a stop. Okay. Looks like I'll be meeting up with a  uh Sheriff Harry S. Truman. Shouldn't be too hard to remember that. He'll be at the Calhoun Memorial Hospital. Guess we're gonna go and take a look at that girl that crawled down the railroad tracks off the mountain. When finished  I'll check into a motel. The sheriff will be able to recommend a clean place and reasonably priced. That's what I need. A clean place  reasonably priced. Oh. Diane  I almost forgot. I've got to find out what kind of trees these are. They're really something. - Agent Cooper? - Yes. - Sheriff Harry S. Truman. - Dale Cooper  FBI. - Pleasure. Ahem. - Good to meet you. - Have any trouble finding the place? - No  no. Your directions were fine. Came out over Highway 2  near Lewis Fork. Stopped at a place called the Lamplighter Inn. Had a slice of cherry pie. Incredible. Well  I'll tell you  we're sure glad to have the FBI here. Kind of lucky  in a way  that Ronette stepped out across the state line. Whole town's really badly shaken up. Sure  nice  quiet place  something like this. Sheriff  let me stop you in the hallway here for just a second. There's a few things we gotta get straight right off the bat. I've learned about this the hard way. It's best to talk about it up front. When the Bureau gets called in  the Bureau's in charge. Now  you're gonna be working for me. Sometimes local law has a problem with that. I hope you understand. Well  like I said  we're glad to have you here. Sheriff  what kind of fantastic trees have you got growing around here? - Big  majestic - Douglas firs. Douglas firs. Can someone get me a copy of the coroner's report on the dead girl? Well  the autopsy hasn't been done yet. But I'll take you downstairs to the morgue when we're finished here. Oh  that will be fine. Dr. Shelvy  this is FBI Agent Cooper. - Glad to know you. - Doctor  how's the girl? She's in shock  suffering from exposure. - Can I see her? - All right  this way. Was she raped? Several times. - One perpetrator? - We're waiting for the results. Is there any connection to the dead girl? Same high school. Far as we know  they hardly knew each other. - No connection. - Mm. I'd like to question her. This girl doesn't even know where she is. Or if she is. What exactly are you saying? We need a CAT scan and we're not equipped for that here. My opinion  she may have neurological damage. She's just not responsive at all. I'd like to examine her fingers. All right. - They've already scraped for particles. - No  that's not what I'm looking for. Oh  no  there's nothing here. Not a thing. Don't go there. Ronnie? Ronette? I catch this fish  pull him out of the water  big mouth. It's got a big mouth and starts talking to me. Wh? Hey  hey. Harry? Dr. Jacoby. Terrible  terrible tragedy. Yes. This is Special Agent Dale Cooper. - Gary Cooper? - Agent Cooper. Agent. FBI. - Right. - Heh. Dr. Lawrence Jacoby  Agent Cooper. Laura was a patient of mine. You're on your way to the morgue now  do you mind if I join you? Yes  I do. Why would you want to? It's sort of against procedure  doctor. Heh. Well  no offense. I thought I could be of some help. You still could be. At another time. Oh. I understand completely. By the way  Laura's Laura's parents Well  they didn't know that she was seeing me. Ha  ha. - That guy's a psychiatrist? - Yeah. I have to apologize again for the fluorescent lights. I think it's a bad transformer. That's quite all right. Agent Cooper  we did scrape those nails when we brought her in. Here it is. - There it is. Oh  my God  here it is. - What? - Would you leave us  please? - Jim. Uh  would you leave us alone  please? Oh! Certainly. I've got to find something to grab onto this with. Diane  I'm at the Twin Peaks County Morgue with the body of the victim - What's her name? - Laura Palmer. Laura Palmer. I got here before the autopsy. Diane  it's the same thing. I had a feeling we'd see this again. What do you got there? Ring finger  under the nail. Let's see what he left us. It's an "R. " Diane  give this to Albert and his team. Don't go to Sam. Albert seems a little more on the ball. - We need to bag and tag this. - Okay  Cooper. You gonna let me in on whatever the hell is going on here? Sheriff  we got a lot to talk about. Hi  Ed. Hey  Donna. I'm so sorry. - Have you seen James yet? - He came by. - Is he okay? - No. Do you know where he went? I've already been to the Roadhouse. I don't know  honey. He told me to give you this. What the hell are you doing? - Well  I came by - I've been looking all over for you. In case you didn't realize it  Bobby's in a lot of trouble. He's my best friend. You're supposed to be with me. We're going to the police station. Look  don't tell me where I ought to be. Second of all  Laura was my best friend. - Get in the car. - Muffle it  junior. - Mind your own business. - You're on my lot  friend. Oh  Ed  I'm not your friend. Donna  you get to the sheriff's right now. Boy  I sure know how to pick them  huh? Ed  you waiting for those drapes to hang themselves? Yeah  okay. Well  I know how to pick them too. Will you do me a favor? If James comes around  tell him I'm looking for him? You bet. And  Donna  you take it easy. Okay. That's the  uh  videotape we just saw. The one we found in Laura's bedroom. Right. At a certain point  I'm gonna wanna show this to the boyfriend. You say when. - Did you complete your forensics? - You bet. All done. - No key yet  huh? - We're still looking. Why not? Diane  I've just opened Laura Palmer's diary. This is the  uh It's the last entry  dated February 23rd. It reads  "Asparagus for dinner again. I hate asparagus. Does this mean I'll never grow up?" And then she's written  "Nervous about meeting J tonight. " That's the letter J  Diane. J And that is the last entry. That's something to get started on. Yeah  that's one out of 26. Yeah  one out of 26. Diane  I've just turned back 18 days to day one. What we have taped to the page here is a plastic envelope containing a white residue and what looks to be a key to a safety deposit box. Sheriff  after you very carefully remove this key  we're gonna run this envelope. And my bet is it'll test positive for cocaine. That's impossible. You ever been surprised before? Mr. Cooper  you didn't know Laura Palmer. Let's get started on a court order to open that safety deposit box  and maybe we'll both find out a few things about Laura Palmer. Diane  I'm holding in my hand a small box of chocolate bunnies. Lucy. Andy  is that you? Tell Harry we found where it happened. Where Ronette and Laura were taken and tortured. Tell Harry I didn't cry. Andy  are you okay? Sweetie? But  Lucy  it's horrible. Andy. Sweetie. Oh  God. This is to reaffirm that you have been advised of your constitutional rights  am I correct? Yes. Bobby  did you kill Laura Palmer? No. She was studying at your house until about 9:30 last night  isn't that right? Yeah. Bobby. Yes  sir. Did she drive herself home? Yes. You two had a big fight last week  didn't you? So what? If I had a fight with her  if I sang songs with her  if I went skipping rope with her  what difference does it make? I didn't kill her. Bobby  here's how this works. We ask the questions  and you answer the questions that we ask. Briefly and to the point. Did you shoot this video  Bobby? No. Well  if you didn't  then who did? Did you know Laura was seeing someone else? That's what you two fought about last week. Look at these pictures. Look how happy she is. You ever do cocaine with Laura  Bobby? I don't do drugs. Excuse me  but what are you charging my client with? That's right. You're a football player  aren't you  Bobby? Bobby  if you knew who she was seeing  trust us on this  now's the time to tell us. Why don't you ask Donna? - She was there with her. - Because I'm asking you. Come on  Bobby. Give me a name. Here's a hint. First initial  J. J. No. She wouldn't do that to me. You didn't love her  anyway. Let him go. Julie  the Norwegians are signing the contract at 4:00 when Mr. Horne returns. Make sure they do not hear about Laura Palmer's death. That will blow the whole deal  got it? - Okay  Bob. - Thank you  okay. Okay  Bob. Okay  Bob. Okay. Julie  what would happen if I pulled this out? You wouldn't. - Oh Oh. Oh! - Ha  ha. Audrey  look what you've done. Audrey Oh Did they scarf that whole damn smorgasbord? - Audrey  honey  don't you go in there. - I'm hungry. Audrey  don't Don't go in there. Audrey. Excuse me  is there something wrong  young  pretty girl? They found my friend Laura lying face down on a rocky beach. Completely naked. She'd been murdered. Hey  buddy. Snake. We're out of here  man. Just a sec. Donna's still in there. - You straightened her out yet? - I don't know what's up with her  man. Forget her. I got it figured  Laura and her. That cop mentioned something about the letter J. We're looking at some freaking biker. And some freaking biker's gonna get his head busted open. What's his name? And we'll finish this quick. Come outside. Robert  I'll be at home this evening  if you need a sympathetic ear. I don't need any damn sympathetic anything. You know  dear  I have no idea what's going on here. - I - Let's just go home. So you were on a picnic  just the two of you  way up in the mountains. Not another soul around? Is there some law against having a picnic? Donna  this is interesting to me. Because with just the two of you out there  I can't for the life of me figure out how these pictures got taken. Uh Well  that's easy. There was this  um  hiker that came along. This woman hiker had a backpack and Um We asked her to take the pictures for us. What was her name? I don't know. I don't think we asked her. I forgot. I don't know. Donna  who are you protecting? Nobody. That's really what happened. Does this person's name start with the letter J? No  she didn't tell us her name. Donna  this is serious business. More serious than Laura falling in love with someone other than her boyfriend. Much more serious than you know. Agent Cooper  the sheriff's ready to roll up to the site. And I've got something else for you here. You can come on in. I know Laura was your best friend. You've been through a lot today. We're finished here for the time being. Okay. Go ahead  Lucy  tell Agent Cooper what you heard. Okay. Now  after you were done with Bobby and he was taken back to his cell  well  then his parents were standing by the door with his lawyer  and Bobby  he was released  and he came out and he saw his friend Mike  who was down by the water cooler  - which is near my desk. - Mm-hm  mm-hm. Okay  okay. Well  I pretended to be typing  but I was typing what Mike and Bobby were saying. And  well  they didn't say exactly who it was they were talking about  but anyway  here's what they were saying. They said the person we're looking for is a biker. Yeah. Looks like a hog to me. Holy smoke. Holy smoke. The Norwegians are leaving. The Norwegians are leaving. The Norwegians are gone. - Everybody gone? Not good. - The Norwegians are leaving. - Norwegians are leaving. - Listen to me. You are throwing away the investment opportunity of a lifetime. Better that than to throw a lifetime away. You stay out of this! - Ha  ha. - The Norwegians are leaving. Sheriff. Diane  it's 4:10 in the afternoon at the scene of the crime. Here's something we haven't seen before. A mound of dirt approximately a foot and a half in diameter. On the top is a gold necklace with a gold heart. Correction  half a gold heart. At the base of the mound of dirt is a torn piece of newsprint written with the words  which appear to be in blood: "Fire walk with me. " Sheriff  you and I have gotta find out who's got the other half of that heart. Mrs. Horne. Mrs. Horne  it might help if you talk to Johnny yourself. So you think it might help? Well  you can tell Johnny one more time that Laura isn't coming this afternoon to work with him. Or tomorrow afternoon or any afternoon. Now  what is so difficult to understand about that? Thank you. Oh  it fell down. I knew Laura. She was always so nice. When was the last time she came in? Oh  I couldn't tell you exactly. Uh  we have so many boxes. You don't keep records? Well  we have plenty of paperwork. Can you tell me how long she's had this box? I'd say about six months. Um  I could check for you. Would you  please? And close the door on the way out. - Okay. - Thank you. "Flesh World. " Man  oh  man. There's over $10 000 here. That's a lot of Girl Scout cookies. Here's a page that's marked. There's your connection. Ronette Pulaski. I can't believe it. Local and federal law-enforcement officials emerging from this abandoned railway car  which is believed to be Shelly  would you please turn the television set off? Why  Leo? I wanna see this. Ronette Pulaski  a second Shelly  turn it off. Apparently escaped her captor and fled to safety  remains hospitalized and in critical condition at Cal Shelly  sit down here a minute and help me out. What kind of cigarettes do you smoke? Whatever's around. No  you don't. You smoke these. What are these doing here? Come on  Leo  I pick up different packs from the diner all the time  me and Norma. There's two things  Shelly. When I come home  this house should be clean. - And I mean clean. - Okay. Number two  you smoke one brand of cigarettes from now on  because if I ever see two different brands of cigarettes in this house again  I'm gonna snap your neck like a twig. Okay  Leo  you have nothing to worry about with me  darling. That's right. Big Ed's Gas Farm. This is Ed speaking. I'm sorry  I know I promised not to call you there  but I have to see you. I feel so bad. It's okay. Why don't I  uh  meet you at the Roadhouse around 9:30? Thank you  Ed. I'll see you tonight. All right  sweetheart. I think I saw a cottontail rabbit. It must have been a snowshoe rabbit. - Snowshoe? - Right. Snowshoe. Snowshoe rabbit. Who's the babe? That's one of the most beautiful women in the state. Mrs. Packard. - Packard sawmill? - Yeah. Where's Mr. Packard? Died in a boating accident last year. Andrew Packard practically built this town. Brought her over from Hong Kong six years ago. Left her everything  which didn't exactly please his sister. That's her right there. The original deep freeze. Who's the glad-handing dandy? Benjamin Horne. Local bigwig. He owns half the town. He's not after her  he's after her land. Who's the lady with the log? We call her the Log Lady. Shh! Ladies and gentlemen  if I could have your attention. Is this thing on? - Is this thing on? - Hang on  Dwayne. Sorry. Mm-hm. Mm-hm. Thank you  Mayor Milford. Agent Cooper? Thank you  sheriff. Ladies and gentlemen  Federal Bureau of Investigation Special Agent Dale Cooper. One year ago  almost to the day  in a town in the southwest corner of this state  the body of a young girl named Teresa Banks was found. She had no family. No one came forward to claim her body. It wasn't even news. Until today. There are irrefutable similarities that for obvious reasons I cannot discuss that lead us to conclude that Laura Palmer was the second  and Ronette Pulaski would have been the third  victim of the same killer. Now  there is a chance that the person who committed these crimes is someone from this town  possibly even someone you know. You are the leaders of this community. It is vitally important that this not turn into a witch hunt. I would strongly suggest a temporary curfew for those under 18 years of age. Keeping your kids off the streets now may teach them a degree of caution that may protect them in the days and the weeks to come. I will remind you that these crimes occurred at night. When I left the house  Sarah was sleeping. Leland made it through the day somehow. I'm not sure I could've done the same. Poor dear. Poor Sarah. Eileen  the brutality  the madness of it. I know. They're not releasing many details  wisely  I suppose. At the scene where it happened No one else knows this. - They found part of a necklace. Half of a golden heart. It was Laura's. They know this because she was wearing it in a video of a picnic they found. The reason I'm telling you this is that Donna was in the video with her  and she won't tell them who shot it or who else was with them. What? But they think the killer may have the other half of the heart. Donna  which do you like better: "The blossom of the evening" or "the full flower of the evening"? Now  listen to me. This is serious. - Well  this is serious too. - Shh. I'm going out the window in a few minutes and I need you to cover for me. Aren't you aware that there's a curfew? They just announced it on the radio. Yes  I know there's a curfew  Einstein. That's why I need you to cover for me. I suppose this will include a phone conversation with Mike  Mr. Bonehead-Boyfriend. No  this is about Laura. And it's really  really serious. Check. - Okay  thank you. - Ha  ha. Oh  I'll need to borrow your bike. Oh  well  then put a little air in the back tire  would you? Yeah. Harriet  don't forget to brush your teeth. Actually  now that some time has passed  I like "the full blossom of the evening. " Hey  Snake! Don't take any oink-oink off that pretty pig. Don't you worry about that. Hi  Dr. Hayward. I'd  uh  like to talk to Donna. Donna's upstairs getting ready for bed  Mike. You're not drinking and driving  are you? Well  we're all pretty broken up about what happened today  sir. Besides  Bobby's doing most of the driving. I'll see if she wants to come down. Mike  would you mind waiting out here  please? The best-laid plans of mice and men. Snake  man. Let's go! Where's your sister? Dad  I'm gonna tell it to you and I'm gonna tell it to you straight. Harriet. See that window? Later. Donna's not here. What do you mean? She snuck out? Maybe you have an idea where she might have gone. Maybe you can help us find her. Oh  we'll find her. Don't you worry about that. Roadhouse. Let's go. Sheriff  I got a call for you from Dr. Hayward. I explained to him that you were on a stakeout at the Roadhouse but he still would very much like to talk to you. Go ahead  Lucy  patch him through. I'm gonna patch him through to you now  sheriff. I'm patching you through now  Dr. Hayward. Harry  my daughter Donna snuck out of the house. I don't know where she's gone. Doc  you rest easy now. I'm gonna put out an all-points for her. We'll keep our eyes peeled. Thanks  Harry. You betcha. Lucy  you take care of that all-points now  okay? All right  sheriff. Of course Donna snuck out. Meaning what? Meaning how else is she gonna lead us to that biker? Right. Then I saw your smile This whole afternoon I've been hanging drapes. - Drapes? - Drapes. Lots of them. You know how I feel about you  Ed. Don't do it for me  do it for yourself. - It's Tammy Wynette time  darling. - Yeah? What about you and Hank? I told you  I'm gonna leave Hank. Before or after he gets paroled? I love you  Ed. I'm gonna do what's best for both of us. When your sweetheart's husband's in the joint for manslaughter  the word "parole" has got a nasty ring to it. Falling Falling Are we falling in love? You know why I'm whittling? Okay  I'll bite again. Why are you whittling? Because that's what you do in a town where a yellow light still means slow down  not speed up. Mike and Bobby. They're liable to be a little trouble this evening. There is a love Meant for me The nightingale It flew to me And told me That it found my love Scotty  Mutt and Jeff just crawled in. Oh  what a wonderful world. Looks like sooner than later. Why don't you whistle for a little backup? I can see which way the wind's blowing. Lucy  get us a backup unit down here at the Roadhouse right away. Make that two backup units. And call Dr. Hayward. Tell him we found his daughter and she's fine. All right  sheriff. Donna! What are you sneaking around for? Everybody's looking for you. - You and Laura  you're the same. - Get your hands off me! Leave me alone. Get off me! - No! - Get your hands off me! Let go of me! - No! - That's enough! You heard him. Let me go. Lights out  Mr. Monkey-Wrench. - You guys got it covered? - That's right. No sweat. Don't worry  I'll take you to James. Joey Paulson. - That's a J. - No  he's taking her to somebody else. I suppose you want me to follow them at a discreet distance. Harry  you're all right. Hold on. Do you think they spotted us? Give me a doughnut. Well  Harry  I think we lost them. Man  smell those trees. Smell those Douglas firs. I think I hear them. - What's down there? - An old logging road. The only access is five miles back at the Packard Mill. And I told Doc Hayward his daughter was okay. My fault  Harry  not yours. - Thanks  Joey. - No problem  James. James  they're looking for you. I'm gonna talk to them. But I think they're gonna lock me up. Why? I don't have an alibi for last night. I was with her. James  what happened last night? It was kind of like a nightmare. Donna  she was a different person. What are you saying? I'm telling you  there were things she was involved with. Things she let herself get pulled into. Things she thought you'd hate her for. She said  "There are things about me. " She said  "Even Donna doesn't know me. " I knew her. I knew her better than she thought I did. Donna  she said something about a guy getting killed. - Who? - She didn't say. But she said Bobby told her that he killed this guy. Oh  my God. This is why I had to see you. It all makes some kind of terrible sense that she died  that someone killed her. I don't know  I can't explain it. I didn't know whether to believe any of this last night. I mean  half the time she wasn't making any sense. I couldn't calm her down. I could hardly keep her on the bike. We came to the light at Sparkwood and 21  and she She put her hands around my neck and she screamed she loved me. I looked into her eyes. They were clear. It was like she was Laura again. She was so sad. She sounded so desperate. Then she ran off. I let her go and she died. Oh  it's okay. It's not your fault  James. It's okay. James  it's all right. James. Oh  my God. I'm sorry. Oh  my God. I changed my mind. I'm not sorry. James Oh  James. Those are sirens. I've got to go to the police. I don't have an alibi. After she left  I just rode around most of the night. James  the necklace you gave Laura with the golden heart. You have to give me the other half. Why? Because they found the half where she was killed and they think the killer will have the other half. If you go down there with the necklace and no alibi - What about you? - I'll get rid of it. - No. - I'll hide it. All right. We'll bury it. Okay. - Right here. - Okay. I'll take you home. - What goes around comes around. - Around and around. - That's not Joey  that's James Hurley. - He'll do. James  stand away from the bike. Stand away from the girl. Put your hands behind your head. He didn't do anything. She's probably right. James He didn't do anything. Lucy  get an arrest form ready. Doc  I'm gonna release her to you  but I want her back up here for questioning first thing in the morning. All right  Harry. Andy  Hawk  put James back in Number 4. James. It's gonna be all right. You. We'll be back to check on you later. Good night  officers. I'm sorry  Dad. Donna  after what happened today  I'm sure you understand what you put your mother and me through tonight. But I also know you well enough to know you wouldn't have done it unless you had a good reason. But we also have another problem facing us  young lady. Where's your sister's bicycle? Uh  I left it at the Roadhouse. Well  we'll have to go get it. I understand you promised Harriet you'd put some air in the back tire. Yes  I did. We're so thankful to have a daughter like you. A policeman's dream. Yeah. Lucy sets it up for us every night. Sheriff  is everything okay? There's extra jelly doughnuts for Agent Cooper and there's some extra decaf. You know  Andy's been drinking so much caffeinated coffee lately Thank you  Lucy. You can go back to work now  and no listening. Sheriff  that reminds me. Can you recommend to me a good inexpensive hotel or motel? Now  it doesn't have to be fancy  and I mean that. I can get you a good rate up at The Great Northern. Because  you know  I think I'm gonna be here for some time  and these motels  they'll promise you a good rate  and when you get there it's a whole different story. Now  all I need is a bed  a bathroom  a telephone  and sometimes a television  in the unlikely event that one day I'll get a chance to knock off early. I can get you a good rate up at The Great Northern. Sold. Well  tomorrow comes early. Diane  it's 12:28 a.m. Looks like I'll be staying locally at a place called The Great Northern Hotel. Sheriff's getting me a rate. When you least expect it. Hello  sheriff. Hey  Jo. I understand you wanted to see the sheriff up here. Yes  I did. Right over here. He's here again. Let's get together and talk about it. All right. It must have happened about this time 24 hours ago. I'm afraid.
s1e2, Diane  6:18 a.m  Room 315. Great Northern Hotel up here in Twin Peaks. Slept pretty well. Non-smoking room. There's no tobacco smell. That's a nice consideration for the business traveler. A hint of Douglas fir needles in the air. As Sheriff Truman indicated they would  everything this hotel promised  they've delivered. Clean  reasonably priced accommodations. Telephone works. Bathroom in really tiptop shape. No drips  plenty of hot water and good  steady pressure. That could be a side benefit of the waterfall outside my window. Mattress firm  but not too firm. And no lumps like that time I told you about down in El Paso. What a nightmare that was. But you've heard me tell that story once or twice  haven't you  Diane? Haven't tried the television set yet. Looks like cable  probably no reception problems. But the true test of any hotel  as you well know  Diane  is that morning cup of coffee  which I'll be getting back to you about within a half hour. Diane  it struck me again earlier this morning. There are two things that continue to trouble me and I'm speaking now not only as an agent of the Bureau  but also as a human being. What really went on between Marilyn Monroe and the Kennedys? And who really pulled the trigger on JFK? Wait a minute  wait a minute. You know  this is  excuse me  a damn fine cup of coffee. I've had I can't tell you how many cups of coffee in my life and this This is one of the best. Now  I'd like two eggs  over hard. I know  don't tell me  it's hard on the arteries. But old habits die hard. Just about as hard as I want those eggs. Bacon  super crispy  almost burned. Cremate it. That's great. And I'll have the grapefruit juice. Just as long as those grapefruits are freshly squeezed. My name's Audrey Horne. Federal Bureau of Investigation Special Agent Dale Cooper. Can I sit here? Well  Miss Horne  unless I miss my guess  your father is Benjamin Horne  the owner of this fine establishment. So I imagine you can sit anywhere you'd like. I'd also like to add it would be my pleasure. Thank you. You're here investigating the murder of Laura Palmer? Were you friends with Laura Palmer? Not exactly. See  Laura tutored my older brother  Johnny  three times a week. Johnny's 27 and he's in the third grade. He's got emotional problems. Runs in the family. Do you like my ring? Very nice. You know  sometimes I get so flushed  it's interesting. Do your palms ever itch? Morning  deputy. Hey  Lucy. Good morning  Agent Cooper. Agent Cooper  I got jelly for you special. The sheriff's in the conference room. It's the door across from the I'll look for him in the conference room. Hey  three for three. Sheriff  let's get James Hurley up from cell 4 and talk to him straight. He was in love with Laura Palmer. My bet is she told him whatever dirt she knew about Mike and Bobby and who knows what else. Then let's have a little chat with those two perpetrators. Let's run a top-to-bottom on Bobby's vehicle  see what that brings us. Also check on the autopsy on Laura Palmer and see what that brings in. We're also gonna wanna talk to Mr. and Mrs. Palmer  let's give them a few days to deal with their grief. I've got the rest of our day mapped out  let's meet back here in three minutes. Harry  I really have to urinate. Oh. By the way  coffee at the Great Northern? Incredible. Harry  as you know  I delivered Laura. I've known her all her life. She was my daughter's best friend. I couldn't bring myself to do the postmortem  so I called Joe Fielding in from Fairvale. He did the work  I assisted. Well  this is what he found. Time of death estimated to be between midnight and 4 a. m. What killed her is loss of blood. Numerous shallow wounds  no single one serious enough to have caused death. Bite marks on her shoulders  also on her tongue. Probably self-inflicted. Lesions on wrists  ankles  upper arms  where she was bound. We're waiting on the toxological tests for drug use. Within the last 12 hours  she'd had sexual relations with at least three men. You've examined Ronnette Pulaski as well? Yes  sir. There's no question in my mind. The same perpetrator attacked both of them in that train car. Doc  when  if ever  will Ronnette be able to talk to us? She had a severe head injury  it's still early to tell. Add to that the psychological impact of the fear  probably witnessing what was happening to Laura before she So beautiful. Who would do a thing like that? Leo. Leo  honey  I have to go to work now and Norma should be here any sec. Leo? Did you finish cleaning my boots? Yeah  I did them and I did the laundry too. All of it? Well  yeah. No  you didn't. Okay  Leo  when I get home  I'll do it. Now  Shelly. Okay. Blood. Shelly? Norma's here. Shelly  did you hear me say Norma's here? Yeah  I heard you  Leo. I'm gonna come by the diner sometime today. Be a good girl and save me a piece of pie. Sure  Leo. James  you were placed under arrest for suspicion of murder. The murder of Laura Palmer. Now  you have no previous criminal record  is that correct? None. No  sir. Did you shoot this video? That's your cycle  isn't it? Yes  sir. The three of us went up there two Sundays ago. James  you were in love with Laura. The two of you were seeing each other secretly. No one else at school or any of her friends knew about it. She was the homecoming queen  she was dating the captain of the football team. How much longer did you think you could keep this relationship a secret? Yeah  well  it was secret because that's the way she wanted it. Why? Was she afraid of Bobby? I think so. Did you know she was using cocaine? Yes. Did you ever use cocaine with her? No  I tried to get her to stop. - And she did for a while. - Why did she start using again? Something happened a couple of days ago. What? What happened? I don't know. I think something scared her because she wouldn't see me. She wouldn't even talk to me. When was the last time you saw her? The night she died. She snuck out of her house about 9:30. About 12:30  I stopped the bike at the light at Sparkwood and 21. And she jumped off and ran away. I didn't see her again. Did you and Laura have a fight? Not exactly. But she said she couldn't see me anymore. Why? She didn't say. You recognize this necklace? Yes  sir. James  what happened on February 5th? And who has the other half of this heart? James  guess why I'm so happy today. Because your skin is so soft and you smell so good? - No. - Why? Because I really believe that you love me. Now my heart belongs to you. I don't know. Damn it. Where's that shirt? No! Hey  Bopper. Since when does Leo Johnson call me at my parents' house? Leo called you? Yeah  yesterday. He was looking for you. He wanted to know where the other half of the money was. What did you tell him  Snake? Well  as far as I knew  he didn't have any of it yet. Because I thought the deal was we were supposed to give it to him today. Yeah  well  I gave him half already. When did you see him? - Hey  I saw him the other night  okay? - What night? The night Laura died. I went to see Leo because I had this money burning a $10 000 hole in my pocket. What about the other half? - It's in Laura's safe-deposit box. - So you didn't get it back from her? She was supposed to hand it over today. Then she went and checked out on us. So how are we supposed to get I don't know  Snake. Maybe we could sell light bulbs door to door. Oh  that's great  that's just That's just great. - This isn't funny  Bobby. - I'm not laughing. We're lucky. We're lucky we're in jail. Because you know what's gonna go down with Leo when we get out. Shut up  man. Don't mention one word about Leo Johnson. You do not know Leo Johnson. Help me. Mom. Hi  honey. Mom  it's 10:30. Why didn't you wake me? I was supposed to go to the sheriff's office. They called this morning and said they could wait until tomorrow to see you. Your father and I thought you needed your rest. You woke us crying in your sleep last night. - Do you remember? - No. Really? We feel so badly for you. We're so sorry. Mom  it's so strange. I know I should be sad  and I am. Part of me is. But it's like It's like I'm having the most beautiful dream and the most terrible nightmare all at once. Your father said you went out last night to meet a boy named James Hurley. Does this have anything to do with him? Can this be between you and me? Of course it can. James and Laura were seeing each other the last two months. I was the only one who knew about it. Mom  James was so good for her. You don't know how troubled Laura was. Last night  I had to see him. We were the two closest people in the world to her. But I feel so bad now. Why  angel? Because we realized that all this time we were the ones falling in love. So I feel like I've betrayed my best friend. And if it's true  then why am I so happy? Oh  honey. Now  you tell me what you wanna do. Should we see these guys separately or together? - No  no  we can see them together. - Okay. Hey  Ed. - How's that coconut? - Well  it's kind of tender. But my pride hurts worse. Ed  this is Special Agent Dale Cooper. - Pleasure. - Any relation to James? I'm his uncle and he works in my garage. His mother's out of town and I look after him when she's away. You fellas plan on holding him? No  we can  uh  release him into your custody. Well  let me understand. Is James being charged? Well  I had one small doubt which he cleared up for me. He didn't kill anybody. But you tell him to be careful because we're gonna have to release Mike and Bobby today as well. - Will do. - Agent Cooper  I've got a call for you from a Mr. Albert Rosenfield. Sounds like long distance. - Excuse me. - Sure. It has that open air sound  you know  where it sounds like wind blowing? - Like wind blowing through trees. - Yes  Albert. Harry  I've been thinking about last night at the Roadhouse. And something's not right. Yeah  when I first saw that bandage  I thought maybe old Nadine caught wind of you and Norma. Harry  if Nadine got wind of me and Norma  I'd be playing harp for the Heavenly All-Stars. Ain't that the truth? I was there seeing Norma  but I was also on my stakeout. And I can remember Mike and Bobby grabbing Donna and I got up to walk over and I got all lightheaded. I was out on my feet before I got there. I don't even remember getting hit. What do you mean you don't remember? Well  I'm pretty sure my beer was drugged. Jacques Renault was tending bar. All right  Albert  bring the boys. You can have the body all day tomorrow. No  I can't do it  they're gonna put her in the ground on Monday. Albert  listen. If you come up through Lewis Fork  I can recommend a place for lunch. The Lamplighter Inn. They got a cherry pie there that'll kill you. - Hi  Nadine. - What are you doing here  Norma? I might ask you the same question. And I will tell you. I've gotten all new drapes for my house. Ed bought them for me yesterday at Gentleman Jim's. And we installed them together. They're a beige sheer. I was up all last night. Do you know what I was doing? No  I don't. I was inventing a noiseless  completely silent drape runner. And do you know how it works? Do you know what makes it work? The thing I thought of at 4 this morning when I was waiting for my husband to be released from intensive care? Cotton balls. By God  those things will be quiet now. Did you have to post bail? No  I had a talk with Harry. There's no charge. Mom still out of town? Yeah  she's still out of town. Let's get out of here. Gonna need a hand from the Bookhouse Boys. - Somebody's gotta watch my back. - Already got it covered. Hi  Mike. Bobby. Well  before we get started  have you two fellas got your stories straight? If we tell the truth  we don't have to get our stories straight. Besides  the sheriff told us we're just in here for fighting. And  uh  it was self-defense. Right. Well  I guess you can go  then. - Now? Mm-hm. Oh  fellas  one more thing. Pray for the health and safety of James Hurley because if anything happens to him  we're coming for you. Sheriff  what are you sitting around for? We got places to go and people to see. Yeah  I think I better start studying medicine. Why's that? Because I'm beginning to feel a bit like Dr. Watson. On top of the morning to you  Pete. Uh  no  Josie  the expression is "top of the morning. " And it's just barely morning. Pete  I want to thank you for yesterday. For standing up to me with Catherine. Forget it. Catherine was wrong yesterday. - Period. - Well  thank you anyway. - Hello. - Pete  it's Harry. I got Agent Cooper with me. We're here to see Mrs. Packard. Um  I will make a fresh pot of coffee. - Hi  sheriff. - Mrs. Packard. Dale Cooper  FBI. You remember him from the town meeting last night  I'm sure. Pleased to meet you  ma'am. Agent Cooper  you remember Pete Martell. - Sure  Pete. - You bet. Uh  can we offer you gentlemen a cup of joe? Mrs. Packard  you said the magic word. - I'd love a cup  thanks. - Sure  I'll pour that for you. Uh  Mr. Cooper  uh  how do you take it? Black as midnight on a moonless night. Pretty black. - Um  please sit down. - Thank you. Mrs. Packard  I'll come straight to the point. Mrs. Packard  I understand that you hired Laura Palmer to come visit you twice a week to help you with your English  is that correct? Yes. When was the last time that you saw her? Thursday afternoon  about the time the mill blew 5. - That would be 5:00? - Yes. And when did she leave? In an hour  when the lesson was finished. I didn't see her again. How did she seem to you on Thursday afternoon? Something was bothering her. But we didn't have a heart-to-heart on it. Something she said though  that stuck on my mind. She said  "I think now I understand how you feel about your husband's death. " Did she say what that was in reference to? No. But after what happened to her  I can't help hearing it in my head. Like some haunting melody. Hmm. - Excuse me. - Certainly. So  Harry  how long you been seeing her? How did you know? Body language. Jeez Louise. Not long. Six weeks. Andrew died a year and a half ago. Fellas  don't drink that coffee. You'd never guess. There was a fish in the percolator. Sorry. Yes  Catherine  I'm listening. I just thought you ought to know what your sentimental  goodwill shenanigans cost us yesterday. You do know what shenanigans are  don't you? Shutting down the mill cost us $87 000 and change. You really think that would have made brother Andrew happy. Jocelyn? Mrs. Packard? Uh  what is "shenanigans?" Nonsense  mischief  often a deceitful or treacherous trick. Why do you always have to rush off? It's been over an hour. I remember there was a time when we used to take the whole afternoon. In the sweetness of passing time  this hour will soon seem like a day. Sing it to somebody else. I'm no peabrain chambermaid looking for a tumble in the broom closet. I'm sorry. Didn't mean to offend your delicate sensibilities. Oh  no. My mistake. I'd gotten used to our conducting business and pleasure. Sweetheart  it's all the same to me. Don't "sweetheart" me  you old dog. I'm no schoolgirl either. What's the next step? Do we escalate? We may not have to do anything. A few more  uh  local tragedies and Josie might just run the old mill into the ground all by herself. The rate we're going  it's gonna be years before the mill's bankrupt. I don't wanna wait any longer. Besides  my knothead husband may peek in the ledger and sniff out the creative arithmetic. Maybe it's time to  uh  start a little fire. Are you talking about business or pleasure? I'm talking about the Packard sawmill. All that dry timber lying around. A stray spark. One night. Some night when Pete's off on a toot with Smokey the Bear. Now I remember how all those hours turned into days. Sarah  darling. I'm sorry to disturb you  sweetheart  but  uh  Donna Hayward is here. Take this now. I'll send her in. - Try not to upset her. - Okay. I don't know what I'm gonna do. I miss her so much. Do you miss her? Yes  I miss her so much. I miss her so much. Laura. Oh  Laura  my baby. Oh. Oh. Leland  Leland. So neither of you saw Ronnette after school that day? That's right. And as far as you know  she went to her after-school job? Yes  Horne's Department Store downtown. What did she do at the department store? She was  uh  a salesgirl. At perfume counter. She used to joke it was the sweetest smelling job she'd ever had. Excuse me. How many times have I asked you not to disturb the guests with this racket? About 4000. Audrey  Julie tells me that  uh  you were in with the Norwegians just before they all suddenly decided  en masse  to return to the old country without signing the contracts. Is that true? - Yes. - Ah. You wouldn't have  uh  done or said anything that  uh  might have precipitated their evacuation  would you? I mean  I'm assuming that this was just a coincidence. - Huh? - Daddy. I did go in there to check out that ridiculous smorgasbord. And while I was in there  I happened to mention that I was sad. About what? About my dear  close friend Laura being brutally murdered. Do you realize the kind of money that your little performance just cost this family? If you ever pull another stunt like that  you are going to be scrubbing bidets in a Bulgarian convent. Oh  Daddy  I'm so afraid. Laura died two days ago. I lost you years ago. For what we are about to receive  may the Lord make us truly thankful. Amen. Robert  uh  I was hoping we'd have the chance to discuss the events of the past few days. Not necessarily the physical events themselves  but rather  the thoughts and feelings surrounding it. Rebellion in a young man your age is a necessary fact of life. Candidly  a sign of strength. In other words  Robert  I respect your rebellious nature. However  being your father  I am obligated to contain that fire of contrariness within the bounds established by society as well as those within our own family structure. Robert  I note your reluctance to enter into a dialogue with me  your father. There are times when silence is golden. Silence can be taken many ways  as a sign of intelligence. The quieter we become  the more we hear. Ah! Now  I am a tolerant man. My patience has its limits. To have his path made clear is the aspiration of every human being in our beclouded and tempestuous existence. Robert  you and I are going to work to make yours real clear. We're here for you  Bobby. Can I get you anything to go with that  sheriff? Agent Cooper here might wanna try a slice of that pie. - Cherry pie? - Best in the tri-counties. Hmm. And could you ask Norma to stop by a second  Shelly? - Sure thing. - Nothing's a sure thing  Shelly. Man  I still can't get the taste of that fish-filtered coffee - out of my mouth. - Me neither. - That's Shelly Johnson  with a J? - Mm-hm. Husband's a trucker  Leo. Minor rap sheet. Log Lady? - Right. - Hi. Can I ask her about her log? Many have. Evening  Harry. Norma  like to have you meet Special Agent Dale Cooper. Federal Bureau of Investigation. Norma Jennings. Miss Jennings  is it true that Laura used to help you with the Meals on Wheels program  delivering hot dinners to elderly shut-ins? Yeah  Laura helped organize that program. Do you have the names of the people on her route? - I can get them for you. - Mm. Would you  please? And  uh  two more pieces of this incredible pie. Okay. Man  oh  man  you must have the metabolism of a bumblebee. For your information  I heard you speaking about Laura Palmer. Yes. One day  my log will have something to say about this. My log saw something that night. Really? What did it see? Ask it. I thought so. Thanks  Norma. See you tomorrow. Hi  Leo. Brought you some pie. Where's my shirt? What shirt? My favorite blue shirt. It's the second one you lost this year. I'm gonna teach you a lesson now  Shelly  about taking care of my property. That means making sure things aren't lost or damaged. Oh  God  please  Leo. - This is gonna hurt you. - No. No! I'll get it. Come on. Uh  Mom  Dad  this is James. James Hurley. - How do you do  James? - Nice to see you  sir  Mrs. Hayward. Very nice to meet you  James. Well  I hope you're hungry. - Eileen's been cooking up a storm. - Yes  sir. Would you like something to drink? We have some soft drinks and some fruit punch  some sparkling cider. Uh  fruit punch. That'd be good  thank you. - I'll get it. - Okay. Uh  why don't you fellas sit down at the table and I'll go check on the roast. - Here's your fruit punch. - Thanks  Donna. I don't believe I know your parents  James. No  sir. My dad died when I was 10 and my mom travels a lot. - She writes for the paper sometimes. - Oh. Ed Hurley down at the Gas Farm is James' uncle. His  uh  wife's the lady with the patch. Yes  sir  that's my Aunt Nadine. She's a real character. Will? Could you come give me a hand  please? Uh  excuse me. We can talk after dinner. It's good to see you. It's good to see you too. That bastard. First your girlfriend  then mine. Too bad we can only kill him once. Hey  what's up  doc? It's Laura Palmer in case you haven't guessed. I'm making you another one of these tapes  which  as you already know  I've mailed to you in one of the envelopes you gave me. It's Thursday the 23rd and I'm so bored. Actually  I'm in kind of a weird mood. God  James is sweet  but he's so dumb. I should have met you a long time ago  Dr. Jacoby  because right now  I can take just so much of sweet. I just know I'm gonna get lost in those woods again tonight. I just know it. Remember me telling you about that mystery man? Well 
s1e3, Previously We'll talk later. Albert  if you come up to Lewis Fork  I can recommend a place for lunch. - Leo called you? - He asked for the rest of the money. She was supposed to hand it over today. She checked out on us. We're lucky we're in jail. You know what's gonna go down with Leo when we get out. No! No! No  no  no  not in my room. In here  in here! - Jerry  back from Paris? - Ben  what a nightmare! Right there! No  right there. What is with you guys? I've got a sandwich in there  I want all those bags open. We're looking till we find it Hey  Audrey  Uncle Jerry's back. - Sylvia - Benjamin! OK  OK Gone! Goodbye! Brother Ben  this is the best damn sandwich I ever ate. It's a baguette with brie and butter. I had four of these every day I was there. You 've got to try this thing. Here  go ahead  eat it. Go ahead. Go ahead! Oh  yeah. This is incredible  Jer! You know what this reminds us of? You know who likes this? It reminds us of Ginny and Jenny down by the river. - My God  you 're right! - Am I right? Am I right? Oh  no wonder! Jer  outside  outside. Always a pleasure. Jerry Leland's daughter was murdered  and the Norwegians left. - Did they sign? - Deal's off. We had those Vikings by the horns! What happened? We're not a hundred percent sure  they took their translator with them. Did you say Leland's daughter was murdered? Yes. I'm depressed. I can fix that. There's a new girl at One-Eyed Jacks  freshly scented from the perfume counter. And you  brother Jer  have a 50-50 chance of being first in line. I like those odds. All work and no play make Ben and Jerry dull boys. - That's right. - Let's jump in the boat. That's great huckleberry pie  Mrs Hayward. Thank you  James. Well Mrs Hayward and I are going to say good night  James. - Good night  James. - Good night. - Good night  dear. - Good night  Mom. Don't worry about the dishes  I'll clean up. Are you coming to church with us in the morning  Donna? Yes. - Nine o'clock sharp. - OK. - Good night  James. - Good night  sir. Hi  sailor! Good evening  Mr Horne. Ben  we're not gonna go in the casino first? Jer  I didn't come here to lose my shirt  I just came to take it off. - Kim  the Horne brothers are here. - I'll tell Blackie. I'd like to order two drinks. One double scotch on the rocks. And my brother would like a double scotch on the rocks. That's two double scotch on the rocks. Next stop  rocket science. Jerry - Blackie! - Benjamin. "Shall I compare thee to a summer's day? "Thou art more lovely and more temperate "Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May "And every fair from fair sometimes declines "By chance or nature's changing course untrimm'd "But thy eternal summer shall not fade "Nor lose possession of that fair thou owest - "Nor shall death brag" - Where's the new girl? When you really want love  you 'll find it waiting for you. Heads. Come on. We'll take care of you  Jerry. Well Donna  I don't think that what we're feeling or doing is wrong. Why not? Because it's the truth. Because I think it would have turned out this way anyway. You do? Yes. I remember a time in school  in the hall. We were suddenly alone  and we looked at each other. I almost told you I loved you then. It's true. It is true  isn't it? Oh  James. I guess because of Laura I couldn't say anything. - I couldn't even let myself think it. - Me  too. Are we gonna be together  James? Are we? Are we  James? - Special Agent Dale Cooper. - Hello  it's Hawk. Deputy Hawk  how is Ronnette Pulaski? - Body and spirit are still far apart. - What did you find out? Ronnette recently quit at the perfume counter of Horne's store. Everything else is quiet  except there was a one-armed man snooping around intensive care. - A one-armed man? - Left. - Did you question him? - No. I pursued  but he got away. Maintain an around-the-clock watch on Ronnette. We'll speak in the morning. Got it? Supposed to leave it in this stupid football. Is it in there? Not all of it. Cash on delivery  Bobby. He's got a gun. - Hey  Leo. - Hey. Who's that? - Is someone with you? - Never mind. Toss it over here  quarterback. It's empty. Weren't you supposed to leave something for me? This barely covers what we paid for. Where's the rest? - Where's the rest of the money? - There's a - There's a problem. - Problem? - Laura had it. - You think you got problems? We can get it. Wait until everything settles down. You punks owe me ten grand. Leo needs a new pair of shoes. OK. We won't take delivery on the drugs until you get the cash. - Do I look like a bank? - I appreciate your position. How could I anticipate this thing with Laura? Laura was a wild girl. Tell me about it. Maybe. Someday. Take your hand out of your pocket  Mike. - What is your problem  Leo? - Problem? You want to know about problems? OK. You 're on the road  driving back and forth  gone for days. - You get back  and guess what? - What? You find out your old lady's been giving it away. - Yeah? - Yeah. Stepping out in your own damn bedroom. That's a problem. I guess so. I guess it is. - Do you know who? - A man needs a clean house. Sure. So do you know who? - I'll take care of it. - Sure. And this other thing  we'll take care of it  don't worry. We'll get the cash  and everything will be square. - Go out for a pass. - What? - Go out for a pass. - OK  just - Run. - Take it easy. Run! Run! Damn it  I'm done  Bobby. Let's get the hell out of here. - Ed! - Sorry  I didn't see it. You stepped on my drape runner! - It was in the middle of the floor. - Think that's an accident? I laid those out there myself. I was up all night working on that invention. I'm going to have the world's first - I'm real sorry  Nadine. - Ed  you make me sick! That's it! Exactly sixty feet  six inches. It's perfect. What do you think he's up to? It beats me. Invitation to love. Each day brings a new beginning  and every hour holds the promise of an invitation to love. Right. - Who is it? - The big  bad bobcat. Are you crazy? What are you doing here? I just passed Leo out in North Bend. - We've got at least twenty minutes. - Where's your car? Parked in the woods. Open Sesame! Somebody might see me out here  and that'd be worse. Bobby  you cannot come by here like this. We can't meet  for a while. What the hell happened to you? Leo Johnson happened to me. That bastard. Come here. Bobby! If he finds out about us  he's gonna kill you. He'll kill us both. If he ever does this to you again  I'll kill him. I mean it. Cup of coffee. It's not the first time  it won't be the last  but I'm in that doghouse again. What happened this time? I popped a grease gun  stepped on a drape runner  and all hell broke loose. I ran into Nadine in the hardware store. All she talked about is the drape runners. She's got one big bee in her bonnet. Bobby sure gave me a good one? - Where do you want these rocks? - There by the doughnuts  Deputy. - Anyone for a warm-up? - Oh  yeah! - You bet! - Thanks  Lucy. Damn good coffee! And hot! Would everyone please take a seat? By way of explaining what we're about to do  I am first gonna tell you a little bit about the country called Tibet. An extremely spiritual country  the leader of Tibet is known as the Dalai Lama. In 1950  communist China invaded Tibet. While leaving the Dalai Lama in charge  they seized control of the country. In 1959  after a Tibetan uprising against the Chinese  the Dalai Lama fled to India and has lived in exile ever since. Following a dream three years ago  I have become moved by the plight of the Tibetans and filled with a desire to help them. I awoke realising I had subconsciously gained knowledge of a deductive technique involving mind-body coordination operating hand in hand with the deepest level of intuition. Sheriff  Deputy Hawk  if you will please assist me  I will now demonstrate. On the day of her death Laura Palmer wrote the following in her diary  "Nervous about meeting 'J' tonight. " Today we'll concentrate on the "J's". Harry  when I give the word  would you read aloud each name I've written on the blackboard? Deputy Hawk  stand here and hold this bucket of rocks where I can get to them. Would you please put on the kitchen mittens. Deputy Andy  move down  stand by the bottle. Lucy  take this piece of chalk. Not too near  Andy! I'm getting excited. If I hit the bottle after a particular name  make a check on the name. Sheriff  when you say the name  state that person's relationship to Laura Palmer. - Ready? - Ready. James Hurley secret boyfriend. James Hurley. Josie Packard was instructed in English by Laura. Josie Packard. So there's no check next to either of these names? That's correct. Please continue. Dr Lawrence Jacoby Laura's psychiatrist. Dr Lawrence Jacoby. You did it! You hit it! Lucy  make a note that the bottle was struck  but did not break. Very important. Andy  put that bottle back exactly where it was! Johnny Horne. Laura was his special education tutor. Johnny Horne. Norma Jennings helped Laura with the meals-on-wheels programme. Norma Jennings. Shelly Johnson waitress at diner  friend. Shelly Johnson. - Sorry  Andy. - Sweetie? It didn't hurt. It didn't hurt a bit. Where there's no sense  there's no feeling  Andy. Coop Tell me The idea for all this really came from a dream? Yes. It did. Jack with One Eye Maybe it's the letter 'i'  but there's no 'i' in Jack. I think it means he only had one eye. Sounds like Nadine  Big Ed Hurley's wife. No  there's a casino up north called One-Eyed Jacks  across the border in Canada. We're gonna have to check that place out. I'm going to erase this  because it's a place  not a person. Maybe the person could be in the place. - So should I erase it? - Yes. Yes  a person could be in a place  or yes  I should erase it? Erase it  Lucy. Next name  Harry. Leo Johnson husband of Shelly  drives a truck  connection with Laura unknown. Leo Johnson. Little Audrey Horne just walked in. Yeah  I saw her at church. Wonder what she's doing down here. - Hi  Audrey. - Hi  Norma. A cup of coffee  please. Remind me to get those 60 watt bulbs. Thanks. I'm gonna go say hi. Hi. Hi  Donna. So my parents said they saw you at church today. I didn't see you. I came by because of Laura. What do you mean? I didn't think you liked her. There were things about Laura I didn't like  but she did take care of my brother Johnny. I loved her for that. Do you like coffee? Yeah  with cream and sugar. Agent Cooper loves coffee. Audrey! But Agent Cooper likes his coffee black. - Can I ask you something? - Sure. Did Laura ever talk about my father? What do you mean? Nothing. No  what do you mean? He used to sing to her. I love this music. Isn't it too dreamy? Hawk found this half a mile down the tracks from the crime site. It's a nasty piece of work. Tell Agent Cooper that Albert and his team are here. - Albert? - A-l-b-e-r-t. - Do we have to stand here all day? - No. Albert Rosenfield. R-o-s-e-n-f-i-e-l-d. Sheriff  this is Lucy. - Is Agent Cooper with you? - Yes  he is. Are Albert and his team here  Lucy? - Yes  he is they are. - We're on our way. - Agent Cooper will be right with you. - I can hear perfectly well  Curly. Albert and his team are cream of the crop. Albert's a forensics genius. I wouldn't expect anything less. But I got to warn you  Albert's lacking in some of the social niceties. - Nobody's perfect. - Isn't that the truth? What kind of a two-bit operation are they running here? Albert  this is Sheriff Truman. I've seen some slipshod backwater burgs  but this place takes the cake. What are you waiting for? Christmas? They're burying this girl tomorrow  and we've wasted half the day getting here. I suggest you and your team should get started. I'll have one of my men escort you over to the morgue. Results from the local pathologist's report. Welcome to Amateur Hour. Looks like an all-nighter  boys. Albert  got a minute? I hear that you 're real good at what you do. - That's correct. - That's good. 'Cause normally if a stranger walked into my station talking this crap  he'd be looking for his teeth two blocks up on Queer Street. Good night  Ed! - Ed  is that you? - Yeah  honey  it's me. - Ed! - Oh  my God. Oh  Ed  I'm so happy  sweetheart  I have to thank you. Why's that? You don't know what you 've done for me. - No  I don't. - Oh  Ed  you big lug! When you tracked that grease into the house today  you spilled some on my cotton balls. But instead of tossing them out  I put the greased ones on the runners. And Ed just listen to this. Completely silent. - How about that? - Oh  Ed We're gonna be so rich! Everything smells like fish around here. Well  you could wash your socks separately. What did that FBI man want up here today? Very nice fellow. Asked a few questions. About what? Well  he talked to Josie mostly. I had a problem with a fish. Took a liking to my percolator. What did he want to talk to Josie about? Why don't you ask her? Here's the key  the ledger's inside. - Thank you. - You betcha. Didn't he ask for me? Yeah  but we said you were on a world tour he should contact your press agent. Get your boots off my bed and go to your room! I didn't want to get mink oil on my bedspread. You got mink oil in your head. Two books. Leland - Leland  stop it! - We have to dance  Sarah. We have to dance for Laura. - Leland  stop it! Give it to me. - We have to dance! Leland! Leland  give it to me! What is going on? Leland! What is going on in this house? Oh  God! Laura  Laura! Laura! "Through the darkness of future past  "the magician longs to see  "one chance out between two worlds "fire  walk with me. " We lived among the people. I think you say  convenience store. We lived above it. I mean it like it is  like it sounds. I  too  have been touched by the devilish one. Tattoo on the left shoulder. Oh  but when I saw the face of God  I was changed. I took the entire arm off. My name is Mike. His name is Bob. Mike? Mike  can you hear me? "Catch you with my Death Bag. " You may think I've gone insane. But I promise I will kill again! But it it is Laura Palmer. Are you Laura Palmer? Harry  it's Cooper. Meet me for breakfast  I know who killed Laura Palmer. No  it can wait till morning.
s1e4, Diane 7:15 a.m. I'll be heading to the sheriff's after breakfast. From there we'll be going on to Laura Palmer's funeral. Good morning Colonel Cooper. Just "agent " Audrey. Special agent. Special agent. Would you care to join me for breakfast? - I'm in a hurry. - For what? Audrey that perfume you're wearing is incredible. - Do you really think so? - Yes I do. Please have a seat. And would you write your name down for me? Here. Okay. There's something you'd like to tell me. There is? You slipped this note underneath my door night before last. I did? I wanted to help you. For Laura. You said you and Laura weren't exactly friends. We weren't friends but I understood her better than the rest. - What is One-Eyed Jack's? - It's a place up north. Men go there. What about women? Women you know work there. Did Laura work there? I don't know. Laura worked at my father's department store. - Horne's. - He named it after himself. Where at Horne's Department Store? At the perfume counter. - So did Ronette Pulaski. - Really? Audrey that rightward slant in your handwriting indicates a romantic nature. A heart that yearns. Be careful. I do? I'm gonna have to ask you to leave now. Police business. Thank you for talking to me. - Trudy two more coffees please. - Mm. Harry Lucy. It is an absolutely beautiful morning. Short stack of griddlecakes melted butter maple syrup lightly heated slice of ham. Nothing beats the taste sensation when maple syrup collides with ham. Griddlecakes slice of ham. Who killed Laura Palmer? Ahh. Let me tell you about the dream I had last night. - Tibet? - No. You were there. Lucy so were you. Harry my dream is a code waiting to be broken. Break the code solve the crime. "Break the code solve the crime. " In my dream Sarah Palmer has a vision of her daughter's killer. Deputy Hawk sketched his picture. I got a phone call from a one-armed man named Mike. The killer's name was Bob. Mike and Bobby? No. It's a different Mike and a different Bob. They lived above a convenience store. They had a tattoo: Fire walk with me. Mike couldn't stand the killing anymore so he cut off his arm. Bob vowed to kill again so Mike shot him. Do you know where dreams come from? - Not specifically. - No. Acetylcholine neurons fire high-voltage impulses into the forebrain. These impulses become pictures the pictures become dreams. But no one knows why we choose these particular pictures. So what was the end of this dream? Suddenly it was 25 years later. I was old sitting in a red room. There was a midget in a red suit and a beautiful woman. The little man told me that my favorite gum was coming back into style and didn't his cousin look exactly like Laura Palmer? Which she did. - What cousin? - The beautiful woman. She's filled with secrets. Sometimes her arms bend back. Where she's from the birds sing a pretty song and there's always music in the air. The midget did a dance. Laura kissed me and she whispered the name of the killer in my ear. Who was it? I don't remember. - Damn. - Damn. Harry our job is simple. Break the code solve the crime. Yeah? Sheriff I'm at the morgue and there's a big fight going on. You hang on. I'll be right there. That was Andy. There's a fight over at the morgue. Albert. You're the most cold-blooded man I've ever seen. I've never met a man with so little regard for human frailty. Have you no compassion? I've got compassion running out of my nose pal. I'm the sultan of sentiment. Dr. Hayward I have traveled thousands of miles and apparently several centuries to this forgotten sinkhole in order to perform a series of tests. I do not ask you to understand these tests. I'm not a cruel man. I just ask you to get the hell out of my way so I can finish. Is that clear? We are here to conduct Laura Palmer's body to the cemetery. If you think we're gonna leave here without her you are out of your mind. All right all right all right. Mr. Rosenfield please. Now uh Leland Palmer couldn't be with us today but I know I speak for everyone the Palmer family included when I say that uh we appreciate and understand the value of your work. But as their representative I must insist that we consider the feelings of the Palmer family as well. Mr. Horne I realize that your position in this fair community pretty well guarantees venality insincerity and a rather irritating method of expressing yourself. Stupidity however is not a necessarily inherent trait. Therefore please listen closely. You can have a funeral any old time. You dig a hole you plant a coffin. I however cannot perform these tests next year next month next week or tomorrow. I must perform them now. I've got a lot of cutting and pasting to do so why don't you return to your porch rockers and resume whittling? That does it. I'm taking charge of the body. You don't touch Laura from this moment on. What the hell do you think you're doing? - Gentlemen. - Whoa! - What's going on? - Thank God. Cooper this old fool is obstructing a criminal investigation. Cuff him. He won't release Laura's body for the funeral. He's not human. - What's the holdup? - Please Cooper. I do not suffer fools gladly and fools with badges never. I want no interference from this hulking boob. That clear? I've had just about enough of your insults. Oh yeah? Well I've had about enough of uh morons and half-wits dolts dunces dullards and dumbbells. And you chowderhead yokel you blithering hayseed you've had enough of me? Yes I have. Ugh. Oh that's nice. How appropriate. Wait in the car Harry. The old rustic sucker punch huh? - A hail of bullets would be nice. - That's enough. The sheriff didn't mean anything. - He hit me. - Well I'm sure he meant to do that. Albert I want you to release this girl's body to her family immediately. I want your test results by noon. Those are orders. Thank you Agent Cooper. Invitation to Love. Starring Martin Hadley as Chet Selena Swift as Emerald and Jade Evan St. Vincent as Jared Lancaster and Jason Dembo as Montana. My darling daughter Jade and Emerald because of my financial difficulties I have decided to end it all tonight. I hope you can find the strength to go on without me. Your loving father Jared. - Uncle Leland? - Daddy it's Jade. - Uncle Leland. - Please. I know you're in there. Madeleine? Jade what a surprise I Maddy? Is it you? Uncle Leland I am so sorry. I'm sure Hank appreciates your unwavering devotion. Your husband has been a model prisoner an inspiration to guard and inmate alike. He greets the day with a smile and confounds adversity with a kind word. Hank's parole hearing is scheduled for tomorrow. Barring unforeseen circumstance with your full support before the board he could be released shortly thereafter. Any questions? No. Will you help find the job that Hank needs to effect a successful parole? - Yes. - How exactly? I own the Double R Mr. Mooney. Oh. You're quite a girl Norma. I'll bet you get all kinds of Romeos in here uh begging for favors. How do you keep them from your door? I usually tell them I have a homicidally jealous husband who's doing three-to-five for manslaughter but he expects to be a productive member of society real soon. Well now that should conclude our session for today Mrs. Jennings. Look at that. Ducks on the lake. So fill me in on Leo Johnson. Leo's one of those guys you keep on a list and you keep your eye on. So far we haven't caught him with his paws in the cookie jar. Morning Leo. Who the hell is he? This is Special Agent Cooper FBI. We'd like to ask you a couple of questions. So ask. Leo is that short for Leonard? That's a question? - Did you know Laura Palmer? - No. - How well did you know her? - I said I didn't. You're lying. I knew who she was all right? Everybody did. - Do you have a criminal record Leo? - Nothing. You can look it up. Illegal U-turn April 1986. Drunk and disorderly November 1987. September '88 aggravated assault charges dropped. I paid my debt to society. Where were you the night of Laura Palmer's murder? - Around midnight. - On the road. I called my wife Shelly around that time from Butte Montana. - She'll confirm this? - She will if you ask her. Robbie. This may be a good time for a brief discussion. You wanna talk about cigarettes? Today? No but put it out. It's a filthy habit especially for a varsity athlete. Yeah I've attended my share of funerals. Too many. Any time a man dies in war he dies too soon. Laura died too soon as well. Yeah she did. But we have a responsibility to the dead Robert. Responsibility is the linchpin of our society. Each man responsible for his own actions each action contributing to the greater good. What's the good of putting someone in the ground? Well it's man's way of achieving closure. In ceremony begins understanding and the will to carry on without those we must leave behind. Robert in your life you must learn you will learn to carry on without them. Great. Now I realize you experience an ongoing disinclination to enter fully into meaningful exchange. This leads to stalemate and a desire on my part to force certain wisdom upon you. This isn't necessarily a bad thing. Sometimes it's the best course available. Son don't be afraid. We'll all be there together. Afraid of what? Well the funeral. I'm not afraid of any damn funeral. Afraid? I can hardly wait. Afraid? I'm gonna turn it upside down! Everybody ready? Deputy Hawk. Agent Cooper there's no sign of the man with one arm. Keep trying. He's out there somewhere. If anyone can find him Hawk can. - He's a tracker? - The best. Oh. Okay Albert what do you got? Enough forensic spadework to save your butt and get mine out of this godforsaken burg. What do you got? Okay first of all contents of envelope found in Palmer diary cocaine. Toxicology results also positive. Newsflash: the little lady had a habit. Next we've got fibers of twine embedded in her wrists and upper arms. Two different kinds of twine. Fibers of twine found in the railroad car. Matched the sample from her wrist. The same twine was used to bind the wrists of the Pulaski girl. Conclusion: she was tied up twice at different locations on the night of her death. Once here and once here. Like this: Sometimes my arms bend back. Here we've got traces of pumice found in standing water outside the railroad car. Soap industrial strength. I found identical particles on the back of Laura's neck. It's not her home-use brand. My conclusion the killer washed his hands and then leaned in for a kiss. Like this: Good Lord. Uh distinctive wounds found on Laura's neck and shoulder appear to be claw marks bites of some kind. An animal. Look it's trying to think. Finally a small plastic fragment from her stomach partially dissolved by digestive acids. I'm taking it back for reconstruction as the local facilities give new meaning to the word "primitive. " I note with some interest what appears to be the letter J. Good work Albert. A couple more days with the body who knows what I might have found? Sheriff it's time. Excuse us. We have got a funeral to get to. Cooper may I have a word with you alone? There's one more item. It's a report concerning the assault on my person which you witnessed. I think you'll find it's quite accurate. Requires your signature. Albert I'm not gonna sign this. What? Albert I hope you can hear me. I have only been in Twin Peaks a short time but in that time I have seen decency honor and dignity. Murder is not a faceless event here. It is not a statistic to be tallied up at the end of the day. Laura Palmer's death has affected each and every man woman and child because life has meaning here. Every life. That's a way of living I thought had vanished. But it hasn't Albert. It's right here in Twin Peaks. Sounds like you've been snacking on some of the local mushrooms. With your behavior towards these good people consider yourself lucky I do not file a report of my own that could bury you in a building so deep you'd never see the sun. Diane it's 12:27 p. m. I'd like you to look into my pension-plan options regarding outside real-estate investment. I may look into purchasing property at what I assume will be a very reasonable price. Mm. Mm! Love me? You bet. This a new one? Yes. Isn't it beautiful? Oh. How do I look? Well you look fine Nadine. Oh Ed. Last night was wonderful. Oh my darling Ed you came back to me. Now I feel like we're really together again. Ed in high school I used to watch Norma and you at those football games. She was so pretty. And you made such a handsome couple. But I knew even though I was just a little nobody just a little brown mouse I always knew inside once you got to know me we'd be together forever. That's not your bike is it Ed? It's James. James who? Oh. We don't wanna be late. Are you ready? I'm not going. It's Laura James. I can't. I just can't. James. I don't care what the doctor says. If you keep indulging him this way he is never going to change. I don't think we should be discussing this while Johnny's in the room. Johnny doesn't even know what day it is. - We have to be patient. - You be patient. I have been waiting 20 years for some sign of intelligent life. I'm clear about this Sylvia. I have my limits. Don't I know it. My let's all spray venom in my general direction. You take it with no problem. Taking it is the specialty of the house. Sylvia I'm going to make it extremely simple for you. We can't take Johnny to the funeral in that ridiculous getup. Let Dr. Jacoby see what he can do. We gotta go. No no. You do it then. Am I going to have to call Dr. Jacoby every damn time I have a problem with Johnny? Oh thank God. All right let's everyone just get into the car. I am the resurrection and the life. He that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live. And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die. For none of us liveth to himself and no man dieth to himself. For if we live we live unto the Lord. And if we die we die unto the Lord. Whether we live therefore or we die we are the Lord's. Blessed be the dead who die in the Lord even so sayeth the Spirit for they rest from their labors. The Lord be with thee. Let us pray. O God entrust this child Laura to thy never-failing care and love and bring us all to thy heavenly kingdom through the same thy son Jesus Christ our Lord who liveth and reigneth with thee and the Holy Spirit. One God now and forever. Amen. I baptized Laura Palmer. I instructed her in Sunday school. And I like the rest of you came to love her with that special love that we reserve for the headstrong and the bold. Laura was bright. She was beautiful she was charming. But most of all Laura was I think impatient. She was impatient for her life to begin for the world to finally catch up to her dreams and ambitions. Laura used to say that I talked too much. I'll not make that mistake today. Just let it be said that I loved her and I will miss her the rest of my days. Amen. Amen. Thank you Johnny. Amen! What are you looking at? What are you waiting for? You make me sick. You damn hypocrites make me sick! Everybody knew she was in trouble. But we didn't do anything. All you good people. You wanna know who killed Laura? You did! We all did. And pretty words aren't gonna bring her back man so save your prayers. She would've laughed at them anyway. You are dead man. You're dead. That's enough Bobby. That's enough. You're dead! Get off me. You're a dead man. Dead. You're dead man. Gah! Dead. That's enough. Come on. Get off me. Agh! My baby. Laura. Laura no. - Hang on. - Can you reach him? No The whole thing has gone haywire. Don't ruin this too. My baby. Laura. Laura. So here's the guy right. He was the father. And this is his daughter in the coffin. He goes boom! I'm telling you Harry he's just not gonna figure this out. Ed that's a bet I'll take for the check. He's right on time. Harry careful who you trust. He's just not one of us. Cooper take a seat. Harry I got your note. Hawk Big Ed. How would you like some fresh huckleberry pie? I would love a slice of pie. Norma slice of huckleberry pie heated vanilla ice cream on the side coffee. Coming right up. Big Ed how long you been in love with Norma? Ed looks like pie and coffee's on you. Okay what did you call me in to talk about besides the highlights of the dinner menu? You better tell him. Somebody's running drugs into Twin Peaks from across the border. We've been working this for months trying to set up a bust. - Top to bottom. Nobody walks. - Who's targeted? Jacques Renault bartender at the Roadhouse. We figure him for the middleman. Now Ed's been doing some undercover. In fact the night you got into town he was staking Renault out. We think Renault slipped him a mickey. Felt like somebody hit me with a log splitter. Ed I didn't know you were a deputy. He's not. Well it's a little outside your jurisdiction don't you think? Somebody's selling drugs to high school kids and I figure that's everybody's jurisdiction. I call Ed in when I need him. He's not the only one I call. - Thanks Norma. - Enjoy. Mm. This must be where pies go when they die. Okay Harry would you please tell me why you really called me in here? You're gonna have to go along with me on this even if it sounds a little weird. - I'm with you. - Twin Peaks is different. A long way from the world. You've noticed that. Yes I have. And that's exactly the way we like it. But there's a back end to that that's kind of different too. Maybe that's the price we pay for all the good things. - What would that be? - There's a sort of evil out there. Something very very strange in these old woods. Call it what you want: a darkness a presence. It takes many forms but it's been out there for as long as anyone can remember. And we've always been here to fight it. We? Men before us. Men before them. More after we're gone. A secret society. Why don't we take Agent Cooper for a little ride? - Where to? - The Bookhouse. This is where we get together. Going on 20 years now. "We" meaning? The Bookhouse Boys. - Coffee's free. - Like the sound of that. Cooper you know James. - Agent Cooper. - James. - This is Joey Paulson. - Joey. Who's this? Bernard Renault Jacques' brother. Janitor at the Roadhouse. Bernard came across the border this morning with an ounce of cocaine in his kit bag. Thought we'd ask him a few questions. Did you ever sell drugs to Laura Palmer? I don't sell drugs. How much does Jacques pay you to be the mule? Jacques don't pay me nothing. I'm no mule. So that ounce you had that was for personal use? That's right. Guess you don't get a whole lot of sleep at night then huh Bernie? Your brother didn't come into work the last few days. Where's he been? I don't know. He got personal business. Who else is he dealing with? Why don't you ask him yourself? He be back tonight. Any minute. He's coming to work at the Roadhouse? He the bartender isn't he? Bernard we've got you tied up in a chair. You're mixed up with your brother in a wide variety of felonies. What I wanna know is why in the world would you tell us where and when to find him? - Yeah? - Leo. - It's Jacques. - What's up? The light. The bust light's on. - Bernard's in trouble. - You sure? I saw it man. You gotta get me out of here Leo. Border run. - Where are you? - Phone booth by the cash and carry. And I don't like waiting man. Shut up. I'm on my way. Hi. - Where you going? - You don't need to know. Josie. Josie what's wrong? Nothing. - Nothing? - Mm. God you're beautiful. Josie there is something wrong. What is it? I want you to tell me. Something horrible is going to happen. - They wanna hurt me. I know it. - Who? Who wants to hurt you? Catherine. Catherine and Benjamin Horne. What makes you think so? I heard Catherine on the phone saying I'd never suspect. Just like with Andrew's death. Andrew's death was an accident. Was it? Catherine keeps the mill account books in her safe. Two books. Different numbers. Andrew built this years ago. I don't think Catherine knows that I know it's here. Why do you think they have two sets of books? The usual reasons would have something to do with stealing. Maybe worse. There were two. I saw them. You believe me don't you? Of course I do. There's nothing unusual in this one. Oh there were two. I swear there were two. Have you seen my tackle box? The next time you and the merry widow wanna take a peek in my safe don't go to so much trouble. Be a man about it Pete. Ask me to my face. Maybe I'll um check the truck. Dr. Jacoby. I didn't see you at the funeral today. I'm a terrible person Agent Cooper. I pretend that I'm not but I am. Oh I sit and listen to their problems day after day. These people think of me as their friend. The truth is I really don't care. I thought nothing no one could ever reach me again. Laura changed all that. I couldn't come today. I just couldn't. I hope she understands. I hope she forgives me. You think it's possible? You think somebody killed Andrew? I don't know. I believe what they want is to take the mill away from me. For Benjamin to have the land. If it was true with Andrew you think they'll kill me too? Think they would? Josie nothing is gonna happen to you. Not now not ever. Not while I'm around. Do you believe in the soul? Several. - More than one? - Blackfoot legend. Waking souls that give life to the mind and the body. A dream soul that wanders. Dream souls. - Where do they wander? - Faraway places. The Land of the Dead. Is that where Laura is? Laura's in the ground Agent Cooper. That's the only thing I'm sure of. To Laura. Godspeed. - Will you dance with me? - No. - Sorry pal. - Please. - Dance with me? - No. - Please. - That's kind of rude mister. - Dance with me. - Come on leave us alone. Dance with me please? Please. Somebody dance with me. Mr. Palmer? Leland. Let's take you home. Home.
s1e5, Previously on "Twin Peaks" Agent Cooper. There's no sign of the man with one arm. Keep trying. He's out there. If anyone can find him Hawk can. - He's a tracker? - The best. My darling daughter Jade. Uncle Leland? Madeleine? Blood? Somebody's running drugs into Twin Peaks. - Who's targeted? - Jacques Renault. Bartender at the Roadhouse. We figure him for the middleman. - Who's this? - Bernard Renault. Jacques' brother. Did you sell drugs to Laura Palmer? Yeah. Yeah his hair was long. Filthy grey on grey long hair. I saw him. At the foot of Laura's bed. He looked like an animal. - Had you seen this man before? - No. Never. His face. My God his face! Sarah did you tell them about the necklace? - They're gonna love that one. - What necklace? She's had two visions. Go ahead Sarah. Leland. Leland. Sarah. It's night. A flashlight beam moves across the ground. Then a hand a gloved hand lifts a rock and takes out a necklace broken in half. It was Laura's. Invitation to love. Don't fight it Chet. You know as well as I there's still something between us. There always will be. For God's sake Emerald. That may be true but I'm married to your sister now. It's wrong. You always said you could never tell us apart so Morning Lucy. What's going on? Thanks to Jade Jared decided not to kill himself and he's leaving the Towers to Jade instead of Emerald. Emerald knows and is now seducing Chet for the will so she can destroy it. Montana plans to kill Jared so the Towers will belong to Emerald and him. I think she's gonna double-cross him and he doesn't know it yet. Poor Chet. What's going on here? Agent Cooper's in the conference room with Dr Jacoby. Thank you. Lucy why couldn't I spend the night last night? Will you be having coffee Deputy Brennan? Was Laura Palmer seeing you because she was addicted to cocaine? Agent Cooper I'd like to help you but I got a little problem here. Maybe there's some sort of hula we can do around my doctor-patient confidentiality? She came to you because she was having problems? Oh my yes. Were her problems of a sexual nature? Agent Cooper. The problems of our entire society are of a sexual nature. Tibet. You know my abiding interests lie to the east as well. But only as far as Hawaii. The ancient Hawaiians often turned to the soothing rhizome of the ginger plant to ease the pain of profound confusion which more often than not was sexual. Ginger is nonaddictive cocaine is. The fact that Laura Palmer sought medication no matter how dubious was actually a positive sign. Doctor Jacoby I understand you cared deeply for Laura Palmer. Why won't you help us? My own personal investigation I suspect will be ongoing for the rest of my life. Laura had secrets. And around those secrets she built the fortress well that in my six months with her I was not able to penetrate and for which I consider myself an abject failure. Doctor did Laura ever discuss Bobby Briggs or James Hurley with you? They were boys Laura was a woman. She had sex with three men the night she was murdered. Were you one of them? No. Who killed her Doctor Jacoby? The night after Laura died I followed a man that Laura had spoken to me about. He was driving a red Corvette. I followed him to the Old Sawmill Road and then I lost him. And that gentlemen is all I can tell you. Agent Cooper a Gordon Cole says you 're expecting his call. - Should I put him through? - Yes Lucy put him through. Thank you Doctor. That's all. You 'll be in town Doctor? Well I'm planning a pilgrimage to Pebble Beach but that's not till the end of the month. Hang loose haoles. - Leo Johnson drives a red Corvette? - Yes. - How we doing on Jacques Renault? - There's an APB on him. His brother made bail this morning. I got an "All Points" on him too. Harry this is my supervisor. - Morning Gordon. How are we doing? - Where do we start? The Palmer girl or Albert's new best friend Harry Truman? - Laura Palmer. - Albert has been very busy. The twine he found on her upper arm is a common household variety: Finley's Fine Twine. - And the twine on her wrists? - Definitely not a match. No ID yet. And those marks on her shoulders bird bites. He'll also fax a reconstruction of the plastic fragment from her stomach. Great. We're anxiously awaiting his results. Now for the bad news Coop. I've got an OOJ and an AFO from Albert concerning his "mano a mano" with the local sheriff Truman. Albert wants this guy's badge Coop. Gordon here's how it is. You know Albert. Sheriff Truman displayed a saint's patience not clocking him before. - He wants it filed with the US Attorney. - File it under F for forget it. Tell Albert if he wants to pursue this I'll fight him all the way to Washington! - Don't get excited - Later Gordon. Thanks. I didn't get a whole lot of sleep last night. The last thing I want you to worry about is some city slicker I brought into your town relieving himself upstream. - This is the man I saw in my dream. - You saw this man? I had an intuition that my dream and Sarah Palmer's vision were connected. I didn't go because I didn't wanna influence her. I'm a strong sender. - The eyes were closer together. - Deputy Hawk for Agent Cooper. Hawk. Right. Stay there. Follow him if he moves. Travelling east on Highway 12 how long is it to the Timber Falls Motel? - 10 minutes. - Half an hour. Depends how you go. Hawk's found our one-armed man. I wish I could've seen Josie's face opening the safe for her lawman Romeo to show him the double set of books. And all she finds is the one I've been slowly cooking. Where's the book that spells bankruptcy? I have more than one hiding place. My desk upstairs. There's a drop panel on the top drawer. Not even Pete the poodle knows about that one. I'm famished. I suppose room service is too much to expect of this rusticated mildew farm. You would prefer the Lumber Baron Suite at the Great Northern. I'd prefer getting on with setting the torch to that damn mill. Harry he's here at the motel. Room 101. Last name is Gerard. Now when the mill goes up in smoke the headline we're after is "Josie Packard torches bankrupt mill in insurance fraud" not "Giant weenie roast in the woods". Mr Gerard it's the police. Open up! What? Jeez! Gunplay. Sounds serious. Mr Gerard! - Don't move. - Oh my God! Keep your hands where I can see them. You let me know if there's any bloodshed. I'm going to give little Elvis a bath. You know this man. No sir. I've never seen that man before in my life. But you know he kind of looks like somebody. Mr Gerard do you have a friend named Bob? Bob Lydecker is my best friend. - Why have you been at the hospital? - Bob's in a coma. A Lydecker was assaulted three days ago outside a bar in Lotown. - That's Bob. - Is your friend Bob a doctor? He's the best darn veterinarian in these parts. Thanks. He's clean: No record no warrants. Take a look at his car. - Your middle name is Michael. - Named after my uncle. - How did you lose the arm? - Car accident. I was on the road from Memphis to someplace. Selling pharmaceuticals. A pretty good job. That's what I'm selling these days. Everybody needs shoes. - They're all for the right foot. - It's my sample case. Two-day delivery guaranteed. We could certainly take care of all your departmental needs. The arm you lost did it have a tattoo? What's this all about? - I'm a shoe salesman. - Settle down Mr Gerard. - He asked you a question. - If you won't tell us we can find out. What did it say? It said "Mom"! Harry. - What you got? - Car was staked out when I got here. It was Josie Packard. I've been doing some research. In real life there is no algebra. Maybe you should run away and join the circus. Escape! I've got a better idea. A tall dark and handsome stranger falls madly in love with me and takes me away to a life of mystery and international intrigue. You mean the FBI agent? Dream on. Maybe. Maybe he'll realise I'm the woman of his dreams because I'm gonna help him figure out who killed Laura. And you 're gonna help me. Fact: Laura was seeing James Hurley behind Bobby's back. - What if she was? - So it is true. Fact: Laura had a sweet tooth for nose candy. I guess it's not such a big secret. I didn't know Laura half as well as you and I knew the score. Laura was wild. Come on will you help me? What else have you figured out Sherlock? The morning of the funeral Dr Jacoby is trying to get my brother Johnny to go the funeral. He tells Johnny that Laura's in a better place now blah blah and he knows that because Laura was his patient. - Laura was seeing Jacoby? - It gets better. - Ever heard of One-Eyed Jacks? - That western with Marlon Brando? It's a place across the border. They have girls working there. You think Laura was one of them? I don't know. If it's true wouldn't you wanna know? It would explain a few things. You know I think about Laura being in a place like that and I get all shivery. But it's like a hot cold. Like when you hold an ice cube on your bare skin for a long time. I'll help you. But whatever we find out we have to promise to keep it a secret. It's a deal. I know where to start. Did you know Ronnette and Laura worked in the same place? The perfume counter at my father's department store. Have a chat with Hank before the hearing. He's glad you 're here. I hope I didn't come on too strong yesterday. I'll be sure to tell him how helpful you 've been Mr Mooney. Haven't seen you for a while Norma. - I've been kind of busy. - So - Business is good? - Yeah. You gotta back me up in there Norma please. I gotta get out. It's starting to put the zap on me big time. I know I have no right to ask and you have no reason to believe me but I'll change. I swear on my life I have changed. Give me a chance to prove it to you. I've replayed it in my mind a million times and I don't have any answers. A car in perfect condition goes out of control. A vagrant nobody knows is killed while sleeping by the roadside. Why did fate deal me this hand? You are not incarcerated for an act of fate Mr Jennings. I accept that but it was fate maybe even luck that sent me to jail just as much as the car accident. - What is your point? - I know I have a lot to make up for. For the life I destroyed and for another life I very nearly destroyed. Mrs Jennings your husband would be facing a difficult re-entry - how would you help him? - I own a diner in Twin Peaks. I can give him a job. The boss is tough but fair. And you would live together as man and wife? Well he is my husband isn't he? We have what we need here. We'll make our decision without the inmate present. We'll let you know by five o'clock today. Catch you later. In my dream Mike said he and Bob lived above a convenience store. Cooper I'd think you 'd be afraid to go to sleep at night. Hey Hawk. Andy could you go into the One Stop and get me some twine? No that's not Doctor Lydecker. - Does Doctor Lydecker treat birds? - Well yes of course. You know there are plenty other vets in Twin Peaks. Only one has a best friend with one arm. Harry in the heat of the investigative pursuit the shortest distance between two points is not necessarily a straight line. Andy. Hand me that spool of Finley's Fine Twine. Miss Loomer we're confiscating your files. What? As clear as the signs on the turnpike the bird that attacked Laura Palmer is a client of this office. I feel so bad for you. I was watching you at the funeral and my heart was aching. I wanted to hold you so much. That James Hurley. He was seeing Laura behind my back. I'm gonna fix him. Fix me first. When is Leo due back? Don't worry bad boy. I can hear his 'V ette a mile away. Don't mess around with this Shelly. Where is he? He's with his friend that creepy Jacques. Jacques who? That Canuck guy that works at the Roadhouse. Leo and Jacques? What's the matter? Gotta think. I gotta think. Well think later Bobby. I have to go back to the diner in half an hour. I gotta tell you something. What is it? I've been on to this for a while checking it out. It's pretty bad. Tell me. Leo and Jacques are running drugs across the border. Cocaine. They've been selling them at school. I knew Leo was messed up in something. I think it's even possible they were giving drugs to Laura. Bobby I have to show you something. This was in Leo's truck two days after Laura was murdered. Are you sure this is Leo's? It has his initials on the collar. He makes me sew them into everything. Shelly this could be the answer to our prayers. What do you mean? You don't need to know. I'm gonna take this OK? You never saw this. Say it - "I never saw it. " - I never saw it. Leo's not gonna be a problem for us any more. Stay clear of him and keep quiet. I bought this. You know how to use it? I thought you could teach me. Teach me Bobby. Take them into the conference room. Lucy go through these files and pull out the people who own birds. - How will I know they own birds? - It'll say so on the cards. OK I'll start going through the files then. Agent Cooper I'm so sorry. My gun just slipped out of my hand. Ever used your weapon in the line of duty? No sir. I can't explain what happened. I've been feeling a little high-strung. Lack of preparation. We'll take care of that. Andy get ammunition from the lockbox. Meet us downstairs at the pistol range. Lucy did you hear what happened? I feel so dumb. I dropped my gun and it went off. - Are you all right? - Oh yeah. I guess so but I'd like to chat but I am under orders to examine these files so if you 'll excuse me please. Laura Palmer's murder was vicious and calculated. No telling what we'll encounter bringing a suspect to ground. After Andy's mishap I wanna make certain we're comfortable with our firearms. Nice piece. Actually it's standard issue; I made a few modifications. How long has Lucy been upset with Andy? - Body language? - It was yelling through a megaphone. - Six rounds a piece to start with Andy. - OK. Care to tell us about you and Lucy Andy? - Jeez you can tell? - Not many secrets left around here. She won't speak to me and I don't know why. And I don't know why she's doing what she's doing. I just can't figure her out. There's no logic at work here Andy. In the grand design women were drawn from a different set of blueprints. - Amen to that. - Amen. Hawk Andy. Rapid fire. Hawk: Six for six two kills high marks. Andy Andy what we need is practice and lots of it. One hour three times a week. Harry supply the ordnance? Whatever it takes. Chin up Andy. - You ever been married Cooper? - No. I knew someone once who helped me understand commitment the responsibilities and the risks who taught me the pain of a broken heart. One woman can make you fly like an eagle. Another can give you the strength of a lion. But only one in the cycle of life can fill your heart with wonder and the wisdom that you have known a singular joy. - I wrote that for my girlfriend. - Local gal? Diane Shapiro PhD Brandeis. Harry: One miss five hits three kills. Excellent. Only four hits? I put four through the eyes and one through each nostril. Agent Cooper I'm looking at the files from Lydecker's. I have here under A's an Arky who's a part poodle part Rottweiler who lives on Maple and belongs to Mr Rumple. I have an Annette an otter who lives with a family near Oak River. We wanted the name of birds. I know but the files are organised alphabetically. - Lucy go through the bird file. - You don't understand. They're organised alphabetically under the names of the pet. We're gonna need some more coffee. Thanks Toad. I'll be sure to get this into my retirement fund asap. Shelly you 're gonna scare the customers. I've got one man too many in my life and I'm married to him. Sound familiar? Maybe you should have a little talk with Leo. Leo doesn't talk. He hits. He was so great at first you know? This flashy guy in his hot car. Then we get married and I find out all he was looking for was a maid he didn't have to pay. I feel so stupid. Look at us. Two men apiece and we don't know what to do with any of the four of them. - So how did Hank's hearing go? - No decision till this afternoon. Have you told him you 're divorcing him for Ed? When I saw him I He might not even get out this time. I guess my plans are a little up in the air. Yeah well I've definitely got plans for Leo. You know what were gonna do Shelly tomorrow? We'll have a day of beauty. A manicure a facial we're gonna have our hair done the works. We're gonna be the knockouts of the RR. It's my treat. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Donna? - Hi James. - Donna. - Hold on. Who the heck ever heard of diet lasagne? Just a sec Daddy I'll be right in OK? It's James. We're having this church potluck dinner tonight. Tell him to get over here. I need help. SOS. Mayday. - Would you like to come? - I wouldn't be good company. I think we need to talk. I found out some things. Audrey told me some stuff and Mrs Palmer saw something. - What? - If you come over I could tell you. I'll get something to eat and I'll be over. OK. Bye. Hi. Who are you? My name's Madeleine Ferguson. Laura was my cousin. James Hurley. Laura and I hadn't seen each other much recently. I live in Missoula. Did you know Laura well? I thought I did. - Here you go. Your order's ready. - Thanks a lot. I'm picking up food for my aunt and uncle. Aunt Sarah can't cook right now and Uncle Leland is up half the night listening to old music and crying. But if I was cooking for them they'd be even worse. - You think I look like Laura? - Yes. We used to visit Twin Peaks when I was a kid. It was great. We'd pretend we were sisters. I wish I'd known her better. It's so sad. Well it was nice to meet you James Hurley. Nice to meet you too. Thanks for calling Mr Mooney. Are you OK? Hank got his parole. He's coming home. What's that? No I don't know what you get when you cross a Norwegian and a Swede. Very good sir. Very good. I can't tell you how excited we are about bringing Icelandic investment to the great Northwest. Would you put my brother back on please? Jerry who the hell is that joker? You 're sure that he's the boss? Make sure they don't start taking eggnog in to the pilot. Jer I've got the jet gassed up and on the runway in Seattle. Usher them through customs make your connection and save me some of whatever it is that they're having. Yeah! Audrey! I didn't hear you come in. What is it this time? Dad are you ashamed of me? Audrey you 're my daughter. I was thinking about what we talked about when you were so mad. It isn't that I'm ashamed of you Audrey. It's just that I wish I could depend on you more. Especially during a trying time like this. That's what I wanted to talk to you about. Dad I wanna change my life. I've decided I wanna help you with the family business. One of these days you 'll need someone to take over. Obviously it's not gonna be Johnny. Oh Audrey! I wish that I could believe you. Daddy please! I saw a friend of mine cut down like a flower that had just begun to bloom. Life can be so short. There isn't all the time in the world. I see that now. And I wanna change my life. How exactly? I don't need college. You can teach me. I'm willing to start at the bottom. All right. We've got some guests arriving. You go upstairs and start making some beds. You still don't believe me? All right. OK. OK. All right. All right. Where would you start? I think I should start at the department store. Cosmetics or something. Part time at first till I graduate. You 're really serious aren't you? You have to start to think about the future Daddy. Just like I am. - The future? - Our family's future. Please let me be your daughter again. Audrey. Hello this is Benjamin Horne. I have to take this sweetheart. Oh OK. Thanks Daddy. Thank you Audrey. Where have you been? Meet me down by the river in a half hour. And be discreet. Here's a bird. Louis Armstrong. He's a parakeet. - Put it with the others. - Cooper Gordon Cole on the phone. Coop Albert is faxing you his reconstruction of the plastic object found in Laura Palmer's stomach. He says the marks on her shoulders are made by a parrot or a mynah bird. That's it. You 're up to date. - Take a look at this. - Something with the letter J. A poker chip. One-Eyed Jacks. Waldo! Harry Agent Cooper. It's a mynah bird named Waldo. - Owned by Jacques Renault. - I'll get his home address. When two separate events occur simultaneously pertaining to the same object of inquiry we must always pay strict attention. Fellas let's make a house call. Jacques it's Harry Truman. Open the door. - He's heading around the side. - Go get him. - Let's get forensics and seal this room. - Harry? - Yeah Hawk. - He got away. I lost him in the woods. Harry. "L. J. " Leo Johnson. - Leo Johnson and Jacques Renault. - That's our connection. Nice touch Leo. Bright red sports car for a secret meeting. Nice. If you don't like it get somebody else. Hank said you were gifted I believed him. But Leo your whole approach it's misguided. Major career opportunity staring you in the face and all you can think about is car wax and chicken-feed drug transactions. I'm out $10 000. Maybe that's peanuts to you not to me. You were in business with a couple of glue-sniffing squish-heads Leo. The Renault brothers? I broke up their act. This is Bernie. Jacques's back in Canada. We had a long talk. He's staying there. Jacques was the brains in the outfit. Bernie made bail this morning on possession. Do we know if the late Bernard gave you up? I told him if he ever did I'd kill him. Did he? No. He shouldn't have trusted me but like I said Bernie wasn't too bright. OK. One last chance Leo. Don't disappoint me. The mill? Keep it simple. Insurance investigator should read "arson" block letters about six feet high. - The deal as we discussed? - The rest on delivery. Three nights Leo. Green light. It's that clear enough? But if Mrs Palmer knows about the necklace - How could she know? - She said she had a vision. She saw someone take it. Donna. Donna it's not here. Somebody must have seen us and followed us here. How? How could Mrs Palmer know? Laura used to say her mother was kind of spooky. She used to see things and have these dreams. Laura did too. - Maybe we should tell somebody. - You mean the police? - If it was the killer then he knows - The police didn't love Laura! Nobody loved her but us. I keep thinking I'm gonna see her. I think I'm gonna catch a glimpse of her out of the corner of my eye. - Sometimes it's like I really do see her. - James listen. We're gonna find out who killed her. This is about us. We have to do this for us not just for her. James I wanna be with you. - Hello? - Josie it's me. We just got a break on the Palmer case. I can't get away. - I miss you. I need to talk to you. - I wanna talk to you too. Josie were you at the Timber Falls Motel this afternoon? I have to go. Call me tomorrow? Goodbye. Blow the whistle Josie. It's quitting time. How did the shift go Pete? Cut some wood made some lumber. - I'm so tired I could eat a horse? - I make you a turkey sandwich. - That's fantastic Josie. - Is Catherine asleep? - Yeah. Good then give me some mayo with that. Josie how do you feel about fish? - To eat? - No to catch. See the Fishing Association their annual do is coming up. I'm defending champion. And this year they're adding a mixed doubles division. I thought well if you were interested What the heck! Would you like to partner up with me? Well Pete I don't know the first step about fishing. Josie there's enough fishing in me for the both of us. - Well what do you think? - Sure Pete. Let's give it the run at the money. Josie you 're my kind of girl. Here. I'm gonna hit the hay. - Sweet dreams Pete. - Sweet dreams Josie. Hello? - Did you get my message? - Yes. Catch you later.
s1e6, Diane it is 4:28 a.m. I have just been woken up by the most God-awful racket which you can probably hear over the sound of my voice. Can you hear that? Up until this moment I've experienced nothing at the Great Northern Hotel but the most pleasant courteous service imaginable. However it just goes to prove the point that once a traveler leaves his home he loses almost 100 percent of his ability to control his environment. Diane I was wondering if you could overnight express to me two pair of those Ear-Pillow silicone earplugs which I used on my last trip to New York. Naturally I didn't bring them with me on this trip because I didn't feel it would be necessary. However Coffee? Please. - What's with the choir practice? - Heh. Business junket. From Iceland. Got in about 3 this morning. Ohh. - They're on my floor. - Lucky you. It'll take them a day or two to reset their biological clocks. - Heh. Hope the herring holds out. - Mm. How are you? Well Audrey to be perfectly honest I'm tired and a little on edge. Oh. I got a job. Good for you. And I thought maybe now I could help you with your case. Guess where I'm going Audrey you'll have to excuse me this morning. I'm running late. I only have time for coffee. Well maybe I could go with you. Wednesdays were traditionally a school day when I was your age. I can't believe you were ever my age. I've got the pictures to prove it. - How old are you? - Eighteen. We'll see you later Audrey. See you later. Bye. Ha ha. I'll see you later Sons of Olden! How do you say that? My brother will love you guys. Brother Ben I bring you greetings from the fertile treeless tundra of Iceland. We have had complaints from nearly every guest in the hotel. What are they on nitrous oxide? They are insane for the Ghostwood Estates project. I have had more serious fun in two days with these Nordic animals. And Ben I'm in love. Her name is Heba. She's a giant snow queen with a smile like a sunrise on an ice floe. You could go blind looking at this girl. Look at this. You see what she gave me? An entire leg of lamb. - Jerry come on. - Is that beautiful? Come on look you crush some garlic some fresh mint that's rotisserie heaven. Come on you gotta meet her. Jerry just grab some downtime will you? We've laid in a gala reception for your fair-haired boys tonight. All of Twin Peaks' best and brightest. We're holding it in a phone booth? And if we still need a kicker to nail the sale I'm thinking that maybe they might enjoy a little road trip up to uh you-know-where. Ah? Jack's. I am honored to know you. Ben? Leland what are you doing here? Well I know there's a new investment group arriving today. If there's anything I can do Leland the best thing that you can do is follow doctor's orders. Go home. You need your rest. I just feel I just feel I need something to occupy my mind. Leland will you take some time off for God's sakes? Fly somewhere. Uh take Sarah. I'm afraid to go. I'm afraid. Hawk we're here at Jacques Renault's apartment. Get over here as soon as you can. - Morning. - Morning. What do you got Harry? Jacques Renault's a Canadian national. He worked the lumber fields this side of the border until he put on a little excess tonnage a couple of seasons ago. That's when he started bartending at the Roadhouse. Harry are there any more doughnuts? Sure. Andy. Thank you. Better wash that down with a cup a joe. I didn't get too much sleep last night. Yeah you do look a little peaked. There's a large group of insane men staying on my floor. Jacques Renault turn up? No one's seen him for two days. We've canvassed the building and the Roadhouse. - I sent Hawk to roust his brother. - I'll get back to you. But it looks like Bernie's jumped bail. There's no sign. - Morning Agent Cooper. - Morning doc. The blood on the shirt you found here is AB negative. It's not Laura's blood. So it was Jacques Renault's blood on Leo Johnson's shirt. Hmm. Hmm. Oh. Thank you Andy. Mm. What about Leo Johnson? Could you hold this? The APB went out last night. Nothing yet. - I need you to find out something. - Could you give me a leg up here? Sure. What's Jacques Renault's blood type? - Alley-oop. - Unh. Jacques Renault's blood is AB negative. Thanks doc. My pleasure. Holy smoke. Flesh World again. Yeah. Harry remember that ad with the picture of Ronette Pulaski? We traced that ad. It came into the magazine in a plain envelope no name. Well the magazine's a clearing-house. Readers write letters in response to the ads and mail them in to the magazine. The magazine forwards them on to the advertisers. No direct contact. Ronette received her letters at this post office box. That's a local ZIP code. Now my guess is that this post office box will be registered under the name of Jacques Renault. Let's see who was writing to Ronette. Postmarked Georgia. Good night. I don't know. The beard sort of ruins the effect of the lingerie. What do you think? The guy's no Georgia peach. Poor bastard. By the way Harry did you notice the picture of Leo Johnson's truck on that page? I love it when you cook for me. Leo hates my cooking. Leo missed the boat with you baby. The biggest mistake of your life was dropping out of the 11th grade and marrying that road hog. What would you do if he walked in right now? Come here. Hey Leo. How's it going man? What a surprise. Now Leo Shelly tells me that you don't like her cooking. Tell you what she and I we're gonna sit here while you cook breakfast for us you hump. And if you so much as utter one harsh syllable to this beautiful girl I'm gonna shoot your ugly face off okay man? Sheriff's deputy. Now Shelly you do exactly what we said and everything's gonna be fine. Okay? Come here. Mm. Oh hi Andy. Come on in. Hi Shelly. Do you know when Leo might be back? Is he in some kind of trouble? No we just wanna talk to him. This wouldn't be about Laura would it? Why do you say that? Well I heard him talking to this guy Jacques the night he left. Jacques Renault? Yeah. They were outside arguing. I couldn't hear exactly but they did seem to be arguing about her and then they drove off together. Shelly you call us the minute he gets in touch with you. Okay I will. Thanks for stopping by. - How'd I do? - You did great. Oh. You drive me crazy. - Hello? - Hi. Hi Leo. Where you calling from? Has anybody come by? What's that? Is anybody looking for you? Why would anybody be looking for you? Are you sure? You know how paranoid you get when you've been popping bennies on the road a couple of days. So when are you coming home? Soon. Everything okay? Yeah everything's fine Leo. Come on home. I miss you Shelly. I miss you too. Hey good-looking. Hope you don't mind my coming. Oh no. Nadine won't be back from that patent attorney over there in Fairvale for a couple of hours. Ah. The famous silent drape runners. She's already spending the millions. Well I have to put gas in my car like everyone else right? You bet. I didn't wanna tell you on the phone but Hank got his parole. Okay. He'll be coming home. I mean back. I only saw him a minute before the hearing. He seemed so hopeful. I didn't wanna say anything. You don't have to explain. Have you said anything to Nadine yet? Haven't yet. Waiting for me to go first? No. It's just that uh Nadine's not well. What are you saying? I don't know. I think I do. I don't ever wanna hurt you babe. Maybe that's our trouble Ed. We never wanna hurt anyone. We never just take what we want. There's a part of me that's beginning to think that this is how it is when you get to the end of your life and that you don't have anything to show for it. Norma. Don't call me. I mean not for a while okay? Okay. I love you Ed. I can remember when you were just a little girl. So did my father speak to you? Yes yes he did. And I can't tell you how excited we are to have you come on board and put in a hitch with us down here at our flagship. So what did you have in mind for me? Well Audrey as per your father's suggestion starting low aiming high et cetera we thought perhaps the Wrapping Department gifts et cetera. Part-time after school. No no no. Emory may I speak frankly? Oh please do. Let's talk retail. Sales? Perfume. One of our more uh sensitive areas. Expensive items delicate customer relations. I'm afraid I've got my heart set on it Emory. Heh. I'd have to talk to your father. Emory here's what we're gonna do. You're gonna tell my father that I'm busy as a bee wrapping boxes with the drones. Then you're gonna put me to work this afternoon behind the perfume counter because if you don't I'm gonna rip my dress in half and scream at the top of my lungs and tell my father that you made a pass at me. Does that help to clear things up for you? Yes. Yes what? Yes Miss Horne. Shall we get started on the paperwork? James. I got your note. Are you all right? Donna there's some things I gotta say. I told you that my dad died when I was 10. He didn't die. He was a musician. We were living on the West Coast. He was a bum and he ran off on me and my mom. I'm sorry. My mom was a writer. She was really good. Poems and short stories. She's an alcoholic. If you have a problem with this I know you didn't ask to hear it. I don't have a problem. You tell me. It's true she was out of town this week but she wasn't traveling. What she does is she goes to another town shacks up in some cheap hotel with a couple of bottles and picks up guys and It's all right. I'm telling you this because I don't wanna have any secrets from you. I don't want there to be any lies between us. It's the secrets people keep that destroy any chance they have of happiness and I don't want us to be like that. We won't. We won't be. We have to do what's right. What you said yesterday was true. If we don't do everything we can to figure out what happened to Laura it'll never go away our whole lives. We will James. She's out there wandering like a restless spirit. I feel it too. We owe it to her. At least they're fresh. Here you go Gary. Oh thanks. - Here you go Scott. - Thank you. There you are. What do you wanna mark this? Mark it duplicate. Do we have one like it? Yeah the same stain. We had it before. Mark it duplicate. Hmm. Red drapes. That PO Box was registered to Jacques Renault. Those are the letters responding to Ronette's ad in the magazine. Let's see if there's something from someone we know. Hawk hand me that magazine would you? What is it? Two different ad numbers mailed to the same post office address. Ronette's and one other. Yeah here it is. "Young student requires education in the ways of love. Only generous mature men need apply. " It's Laura. You see some identifying mark? - The drapes. - Drapes? Red drapes Harry from my dream. Now why would an apartment dweller like Jacques buy 50 gallons of heating oil? Yeah yeah I already got it. To heat a log cabin. Harry you're all right. Jacques' brother said something about a place up near the state line. Fellas let's pack a lunch. We're taking a walk in the woods. Madeleine. - Hi. - Hi. Hi. I'm Madeleine Ferguson. My friends call me Maddy. This is really nice of you guys. I don't really know anybody in town except Aunt Sarah and Uncle Leland. And the mood at the house you can probably guess isn't that great right now. Would you like something to drink? A cherry Coke would be great. You got it. Madeleine. If I said that you can't really say a word of this to anyone not a soul not even your aunt or uncle would that be okay with you? It sounds like some big secret. It is. James and I knew Laura better than anyone did. She was in some kind of terrible trouble before she died worse than any of us could imagine. What? Well I'd rather not say too much about things we can't prove yet. You said you can't prove it yet. We loved Laura. We're afraid that the truth might never come out or that the person who killed her might never be caught. We've sworn on her memory not to let that happen. My God. You know who did it? We have some ideas. We wanted to talk to you about this because we need your help. What do you want me to do? Laura used to talk about a secret hiding place she had somewhere in her house maybe in her room. I'm not really sure. But nobody else knew about it. We think she might have left something there that could lead us to the killer. I'll help you. You will? The day before she died I had a feeling that Laura was in trouble. I've always felt close to her. That's why I came here. You know I didn't really know Laura that well but I feel like I do. Our folks were always telling us how much alike we were. Will you call me if there's anything I can do? I don't think there'll be any problem. This is really great. Call me Maddy. - Hi. - Hi Norma. We look like a couple of refugee beauty queens. You don't know how really good-looking you are. I never felt so glamorous. Hope I don't chip a nail slinging plates around. Hi Norma. Hello Hank. Surprised to see me huh? Yes. Is that Leo's girlfriend? Wife. That Leo. So impulsive. Not much meat on her though. Hey I don't expect a kiss or anything. I figure I gotta earn my way back into your heart. But Norma I intend to try. So where do I start? Washing dishes will be fine. Can I finish my coffee first boss? Oh no. Oh no. No. You little Froot Loop. You're done! Done! Don't ever cross me. Tune in tomorrow for Invitation to Love. He's been spending more and more of his time alone in his room. It's become much more difficult to engage him in conversation. Terrible mood swings. We've been told by the school that his attendance has become erratic at best. And then there's the matter of public fighting both at the Roadhouse and at the funeral. Are you using drugs Bobby? Nope. - Alcohol. - Alcohol's a drug. - Well that's not what he meant. - Alcohol doesn't count? Everybody drinks. Are you unhappy Bobby? Shouldn't I be? Well that's not for me to say. Have you ever killed anybody? - Have you? - My father has. - During wartime. - That's different. Different from what? Perhaps I should spend a few minutes with Bobby alone. This is supposed to be family counseling. Well and I'll need to spend some time with each member of the family alone but Bobby first. - Fair enough. - Whatever you say. Bobby let's just cut the crap huh? Okay so your parents don't understand what you're going through right now. Heh. That's a good one. Let's talk about Laura. Okay. Let's talk about Laura. Bobby what happened the first time that you and Laura made love? What the hell kind of question is that? Bobby did you cry? Did I what? And then what did Laura do? Did she laugh at you? Were you very sad when Laura died? - Laura wanted to die. - How do you know that? Because she told me. What else did she tell you? Did she tell you there was no goodness in the world? She said people tried to be good but they were really sick and rotten her most of all. And every time she tried to make the world a better place something terrible came up inside her and pulled her back down into hell. It took her deeper and deeper into the blackest nightmare. And every time it got harder to go back up to the light. Did you sometimes have the feeling that Laura was harboring some awful secret? Yeah. Bad enough that she wanted to die because of it? Yes. Bad enough that it drove her to consciously try to find people's weaknesses and prey on them tempt them break them down make them do terrible degrading things? - Yes. - Laura wanted to corrupt people. Because that's how she felt about herself. Yes. Is that what happened to you Bobby? Is that what Laura did to you? She wanted so much. She made me sell drugs so she could have them. This way. Through here. Watch your step there city boy. Thanks Harry. What is it Hawk? Is that the cabin we're looking for? Maybe maybe not. You might wanna hang back a step doc. Huh. Might want to anyway. About time you got here. They move so slowly when they're not afraid. Come on then. My log does not judge. I've got tea. I've got cookies. No cake. Well that's very kind of you ma'am but I don't believe that What kind of cookies? Sugar. The owls won't see us in here. A cup of tea would be very nice. Shut your eyes and you'll burst into flames. Thanks Margaret. We'll let it steep. Wait for the tea. The fish aren't running. You've been expecting us Margaret? You're two days late. But that's your concern. My log saw something. Something significant. What did your log see? Tea first. Then be ready. Thank you. - My husband was a logging man. - Oh? He met the devil. Fire is the devil hiding like a coward in the smoke. It was the day after the wedding wasn't it Margaret? The wood holds many spirits doesn't it Margaret? You can ask it now. What did you see that night? The night Laura Palmer was killed? Shh. I'll do the talking. Dark. Laughing. The owls were flying. Many things were blocked. Laughing. Two men. Two girls. Flashlights pass by in the woods over the ridge. The owls were near. The dark was pressing in on her. Quiet then. Later footsteps. One man passed by. Screams far away. Terrible. Terrible. One voice. - Man or girl? - Girl. Further up. Over the ridge. The owls were silent. The two girls were Laura and Ronette. The two men Jacques maybe Leo. Maybe. Who's the third man? Do you hear it? This way. And there's always music in the air. Waldo. There's film in here. Blood. One-Eyed Jack's. Evening Mr. and Mrs. Showel. - Okay. Go right ahead. - Thank you. Good evening. - Catherine Martell and spouse. - Mm-hm. Go easy on the sauce tonight okay Cathy? Couple of belts and even you might start to look good to me. Of course the modern age has changed forever the way your people live Mr. Thorson. But it would be my guess that there still remains a tremendous vestigial interest in the legends and folklore of ancient Iceland. Vestigial. Absolutely. Heba did you know that was an American figure of speech? No Jerry. Ha ha. Heba Heba. You never heard that before? No Jerry. Ha-ha-ha. Do you realize the incredible potential that could result from our taking a mutual dip in each other's respective gene pools? Heba I wanna cook for you. Very very good. That's funny. So he says "What do you get when you cross a Norwegian with a Swede? A socialist who wants to be king. " Well I can remember it was I think oh somewhere in the '50s I came through your country. Beautiful beautiful. Not many trees though you know but Hmm. Would you excuse me? Of course. Meet me in my office. Give me two minutes to break away. - Hell hath no fury. - What? Two minutes. Ah Thor I've been meaning to ask you are you familiar with the word luhamsta? Catherine we agreed no scenes in front of the guests. Let's keep the melodrama to a minimum. The next thing I know you're polishing my shoes with Dom PÃ©rignon. Fill me in. What's eating you? Why did you have this thousand-dollar poker chip from you-know-where in your pants yesterday? I thought you preferred women with certain experience. Hmm. Jerry gave me that. It's a good-luck charm. I thought I'd lost it. I'm so relieved that you found it. Are you quite finished? Yes. In that case Oh. Let's burn the mill. Let's do it tonight. No my love. We'll give Josie one last chance to sell. Tomorrow. Failing that I have retained the services of a qualified professional. Breath mint? Now let me get this straight. Your entire country is above the timberline? Folks ladies and gentlemen can I have your attention please? Can I have your attention? Heh. First off I wanna thank you all for turning out to welcome our neighbors from the magical isle of Iceland. We are all Icelanders. The Ghostwood Estates project is an important part of our future here in Twin Peaks and there's no one we'd rather have as partners in our future than What? Dance with him. It is serious. Dance with him. All right. Jerry what's going on? Get Jacoby get a net but get him out of my life. What are they doing? Jerry. Jerry. Gather round. Donna? It's Maddy. I was looking in Laura's room and I remembered when we were younger she used to hide cigarettes in her bedpost. The top of one of the posts screws off. I found a tape in her hiding place. Leland? Where did you go? I'll meet you and James tomorrow. - Okay. And bring a tape recorder. - Leland? Did anyone see you come in here? No. You do realize the risk if anyone sees us. This was hidden in her desk where you said it would be. - Then we can proceed. - When? Tomorrow night. Over here. Told you to mind the store Leo not open your own franchise. - Hank I - Do as you're told Leo. Next time you'll watch me take your little chippy apart before I kill you. Get me a beer Shelly. Honey what happened? Are you okay? - Just get me a damn beer! - Aah! Get up and What the hell are you doing with that? You're not gonna hurt me again. Don't touch me. Don't come near me Leo. You stupid little slut. You haven't got the guts. Reach over and turn on the light. Don't make me leave. Please don't make me leave.
s1e7, Previously on "Twin Peaks" You 'll put me to work behind the perfume counter. Does that clear things up? So where do I start? Washing dishes will be fine. Donna it's Maddy. I found a tape in her hiding place. I'll meet you and James tomorrow and bring a tape recorder. Why would an apartment dweller like Jacques buy so much heating oil? To heat a log cabin. - What did you see that night? - Two men two girls. Screams. We'll give Josie a chance to sell tomorrow. You do realise the risk if anyone sees us. Don't touch me! Don't come near me Leo! Don't make me leave please. Don't make me leave. Audrey you 're a high school girl. I'm an agent of the FBI. So do you want me to leave or what? What I want and what I need are two different things Audrey. When a man joins the Bureau he takes an oath to uphold certain values. Values that he's sworn to live by. This is wrong Audrey. We both know it. - But don't you like me? - I like you very much. You 're beautiful intelligent desirable. Everything a man wants in his life. But what you need right now more than anything is a friend. Someone who will listen. Friends huh? I'm gonna go and get us two malts and some fries. - Then tell me all your troubles. - That could take all night. The night is young. Now I'm gonna get the food and you 're gonna get dressed. - I can't tell you all my secrets. - Secrets are dangerous things. - Do you have any? - No. Laura had a lot of secrets. Finding those out is my job. Good morning Officer Brennan. I sure wish you would stop calling me Officer Brennan. Officer Andy this is peak activity time at the station switchboard. So it's really not convenient for me to talk right now. Twin Peaks Sheriff's Station may I help you? One moment please. Doctor Stanicek? Yes it's me. Oh. Uh-huh. Well thank you Doctor. No I'm fine. Bye. Morning Lucy. I heard you were out sick. I'm much better today thanks. Good. I found it: "Gracula religiosa. "Commonly known as the hill mynah. "Native to Southeast Asia Indonesia. "Feeds on fruit mainly some invertebrates. "Its ability to mimic the human voice is amazing. " Yeah well so far we haven't heard a peep. Hey Waldo what's up? It says here that mimicry is a kind of play with the mynah. But this one's in a weakened condition. Starved dehydrated. I'd say he's feeling anything but playful. Here you go little fella. - You want to feed him Agent Cooper? - I don't like birds. When do you think he'll start talking? According to the book his urge to mimic should return with his health. - If it does then we got a witness. - Well we better keep feeding him. - You got any apples? - Yeah. There's some in the fridge. - These grapes are on the edge. - These came in from your office. Forensics confirms Jacques had three guests to his cabin: Laura Palmer Ronnette Pulaski and Leo Johnson. That was the only exposed negative on the roll of film. Look familiar? - That's our Waldo. - No Harry the girl. That's Laura. Well now we know who and when. We don't know why. Voice activated Harry. When the bird talks maybe we'll get some answers. This matches the fragment found in Laura's stomach. - A chip from One-Eyed Jacks. - Renault deals in the casino. - A little fieldwork is in order. - Jacks is over the border. Well I know that Harry. That's why I was thinking this would be a job for the Bookhouse Boys. Better call Hawk on that one. Shelly! Bobby Briggs. Come on lover-boy. Leo's waiting. - I called but your dad answered. - Bobby's here baby. Bobby's here. I shot him Bobby. I know I did. He just screamed and screamed. He sounded like an animal. You what? Slow down Shelly. Talk to me. He's out there I know he is. He's gonna kill me. - Bobby he's gonna kill me. - Shelly! Start over. Go real slow. Leo came home late last night. He was all beat up. He had blood all over him. I told him I was never ever gonna let him hurt me again. But he came at me. So I pulled the trigger. I shot him Bobby. What am I gonna do? Where am I gonna hide? Shelly Leo Johnson is history. Understand? I'm taking care of you from now on. I'm gonna deal with Leo. I'm gonna deal with James. Bobby's gonna deal with everything. Birdseed? No this bird eats fruit. The sheriff says it's a witness. No not just because it saw something because it talks. It needs to eat What's up Doc? Just a few words before I go to sleep. I feel like I'm gonna dream tonight. Big bad ones you know? The kind you like. It's easier talking into the recorder. I guess I feel I can say anything. All my secrets. The naked ones. I know you like those Doc. I know you like me too. That'll be my little secret OK? Just like your coconut. Why is it so easy to make men like me? And I don't even have to try very hard. Or maybe if it was harder This one's empty. February 23rd. The night Laura died. - The tape's not in there. - He must still have it. - She died he never returned it. - Do you think Dr Jacoby killed her? We're gonna find that tape. Tonight. - Where? - Jacoby's office. - What if he's there? - We'll get him out. How? Maybe he gets a phone call. From Laura. What's up Doc? Just a few words before I go to sleep. I feel like I'm gonna dream tonight. Here try this. It smells like a florist. This won't do. I want something more fruity. - Fruity? - As in fruit. Jenny could I see you in my office in five minutes? I'm not making myself clear. I want to make a statement. Maybe you should try hanging it around your neck. It's a perfume it's a fashion accessory. Two statements for the price of one. I don't appreciate your attitude. Well thank you for shopping at Horne's Department Store. - I'm going to the girls' room. - OK. There's a real bad accident outside. It sounded like a bus or something. Come right this way Jenny. I have something really special to talk about today. Come right in. My my you look lovely. - Sit sit. - Thank you Mr Battis. This is for you Jenny. A reward for a job well done. It's a unicorn. Ancient symbol of purity. Tamed only by the young at heart. Wow a unicorn. - Have a good time at the club? - I had a great time Mr Battis. They were pleased with you as well I must say. They'd like you to continue. Believe me not many girls qualify. - Really? - Yes. Now the variety of work is completely up to you. Hostess cocktail waitress. Or if you are chosen hospitality girl. What's that? Hospitality girls escort important guests VIPs. It's a lucrative opportunity Jenny. Attending to wealthy men in need of a little company. That sounds cool. As long as they're wealthy. Jenny your attitude will take you far in this life. Call this number ask for Black Rose. Why don't we go to Eveningwear and find you something elegant? Elegant sounds great Mr Battis. Elegant. How do you feel about rose? Ronnette Pulaski. In prison you remember faces from home. Even people you barely knew seem like friends. - It's something to hang on to. - Must've been hard on you. I paid my debt that's what counts. You were a really big help around here. I wanna thank you for getting Norma through. You 're welcome Hank. It's no problem. She told me in her letters how much it meant how much Pete helped. - Pete? - Yeah. No not Pete - No you mean Ed. - Yeah Big Ed. Yeah I'm a little better at faces than names I guess. Yeah Big Ed. Shelly can we get another cup over here? - Hello Hank. - Hi Harry. Glad to see me? You looking for a free lunch? - I recommend the meatloaf. - Well save it. I'm looking for you. - Harry I'm innocent. - What you are is on parole. You pay your case officer a visit once a week Fridays. You miss a visit you go to jail. Got it? Thanks for the reminder Sheriff. Stop in any time. You think people really change Cooper? I don't. Oh afternoon guys. Would you like some coffee? - Afternoon Shelly. Yes. - We should be on our way. Harry I'm gonna let you in on a little secret. Every day once a day give yourself a present. Don't plan it don't wait for it just let it happen. Could be a new shirt a catnap in your office chair or two cups of good hot black coffee. - Like this. - A present. - Like Christmas? - Yeah. Man that hits the spot. Nothing like a great cup of black coffee. Bye Audrey. - So did Battis get you a dress? - Yeah he did. - Me too. I'm gonna be hostess. - Oh really. Cool. - Get one of these too? - What will I do with a horned horse? - Ditto. I bet he's cartons of them. - He probably does. God I did a really dumb thing. I lost that number he gave me for Black Rose do you have it? - Yeah. I got it. - Great. Here. Thanks. - OK I'll talk to you later. - OK see you tomorrow. I wasn't fooling Montana. You show them Chet. You show all of them. Tune in tomorrow for "Invitation to Love". Ed. I'm eating bonbons. - Come on honey. It's not that bad. - You don't know how bad it is. You don't know all the things I was gonna do for us. I know. A new TV. I was gonna do that. - I already looked at a motorboat. - Sweetheart It wasn't just things I was gonna buy. It was the new life we were gonna lead. Nadine there's plenty of patent attorneys. We just gotta find one who understands drape runners. Rejected. Rejected that's what he said. - Nobody will say anything different. - Don't give up. Don't you dare. I just got that baby back from Tim and Tom's Taxidermy. When I caught him he was this big. I guess by the time they take the innards out and put the stuffing in it loses something in the translation. Well Pete it's still a fine looking trophy no matter what the size. Yeah well size isn't everything I guess. Harry I didn't expect you to be here. I'm late for the mill but I'll make time for us. What's wrong? What were you doing at the Timber Falls Motel Tuesday? - Tuesday I was at the mill. - Hawk saw you. I know you were there. Harry You can tell me anything. Josie you can tell me anything. I was there because Ben and Catherine were there together. I followed them and I took pictures. What's this all about? You asked me for proof last time and I followed them and I took pictures. The other night I heard Catherine talking on the phone. Something about an accident. A fire. A fire at the mill. A fire at Andrew's mill. My mill. I'm not gonna let this happen. No. Neither will I. I won't let it happen. - Well now. - Evening Harry. Ed you all set? - Is that what you 're wearing? - It's pretty spiffy. Like to gamble Ed? I went to Reno once. But I never felt too lucky. Well you 're gonna be lucky tonight. It's $10 000 of the Bureau 's money. Whenever I gamble I bring back 10 to How about 300? And Ed the suit is perfect. Well Harry'd like to talk with you. So why don't I see you outside? Yeah Harry what's on your mind? I'm worried about Josie. She's been real afraid. - About what? - Ben Horne and Catherine Martell. They've seen each other on the side for years Josie just found out. She thinks they're planning to burn down the mill and get rid of her. Well do you believe her? Ben Horne wants that land for Ghostwood development and Josie won't sell. - Yeah I believe her. - How much do you know about her? Where she's from? Who she was before? - What are you getting at? - The truth. That's my job. I know all I need to know. I love her and she's in trouble. That's good enough for me. Let's look into it. Thanks. - Is Hawk ready? - Yeah he's outside in the van. - I got that new Cadillac you wanted. - Good. It's perfect for our cover. - High rollers from the Tri-Cities? - Oral surgeons Harry. Big spenders vacationing among the firs. Yeah has Agent Cooper returned yet? I need to leave another message. Tell him that Audrey called again. Yes it's still urgent. - Thanks for seeing me Mrs Martell. - It's all right. - Normally I never impose this late. - That's fine. What's this about? Every agent is instructed five signatures and somehow we missed one. - Refresh my memory. What policy? - Your new life insurance. Since the binder takes effect tonight I had no choice. It couldn't wait. Right here please. Is everything in order Mrs Martell? Yes it's just This was handled without our meeting each other and I'd almost forgotten. To be honest with you Mrs Martell I withheld that last page. - Did you? - I admit I thought it unusual. Life insurance and the client is too busy to be involved? I mean you did know about this policy didn't you? Are you suggesting that there's something irregular at work here? I never got that idea from Mrs Packard. Or from Mr Horne. When he offered to collect signatures I thought it was fine. Just with a new account I like to be certain to cross every "t". Right here please. You know I'm noticing there are some minor changes that I asked my attorney to make that are not included in this draft. I'd like to go over this with him in the morning and initial the changes and get the documents to you at that time. If there's anything that I can do to help you with the policy or anything at all - Are you an ambitious man Mr Neff? - One likes to think so. One never knows. There may be a few "t's" left to cross. - Goodnight. - Mrs Martell. I'll see myself out. Think. Think. Ed why don't you open that up? Wow. Look at all this. Well I'm sorry. There's a curly-haired wig in there. Ed it's gonna work like gangbusters. I'll help you on with one of those moustaches. - Will it fit? I've got a big head. - OK give it a try. Testing: One two.

Casino's that way. This might just be your lucky night. Luck has nothing to do with it. Not bad Ed. Not bad at all. Hawk we have a small casino room with the usual games of chance.

Welcome to One-Eyed Jacks Hester. Place your bets. - Jacques is it? - That's me. Say goodbye James. What's up Doc? I want to see you. - Where do we look? - I don't know. Everywhere. Where shall we start? Maybe this is something. Umbrellas? "The Kahala Hilton July 1969 men on the moon" "August 9th 1974 " "I first lay eyes on Mimsy. " - Weird! - Yeah. - James! - What d'you do? - I just hit a button. - Hit it again. There's gotta be a way to turn it off. My little coconut. James! Laura said something on her tape about a coconut. Oh my God the necklace! OK Laura this is where you shot that video. Now just tell me Tell me why you sent me to Sparkwood and 21? Oh my God! No! - Red 36. - Sorry I guess our date's off. - 77. - Pay red. No let it ride. Excuse me can I get? Sir are you absolutely sure you want another card? Yes please. Twenty-one! Can you beat that? Mother always said I was born lucky. Maybe later. Thanks for asking. This is for you. I'm a friend of Leo's. Who's Leo? Buy you a cocktail Jacques? Come in. Turn around. Yes Very nice. Come over here. - Something wrong? - Uh-uh. This is a good night for you to break in. The owner's coming by he likes to spend time with the new girls. - Who's that? - No names child. You don't offer and you don't ask. Yes ma'am. Pick a card. - How long you been dealing Blackjack? - Long enough to spot a card counter. You let card counters buy you a drink? I don't see tips like that everyday. - Leo ever mention me to you? - I don't know Mr. Who are you? I can't believe Leo never told you about me. - Maybe he did I don't know. - Leo played you like a violin. He had you taking all the risk and never cut you a piece of the action. I don't know what you 're talking about. Take that chip out of your pocket and take a look. Go ahead. That chip has a special significance. A very special night you spent up at your cabin. Here's a clue. "Laura! Laura!" Come on take it easy. Take it easy! How do you think a low-rent hump like Leo has been financing this? You I'm the bank. - He never mentioned your name. - Course not. Leo buys with my cash and you mule it across the border. - He tell you who's distributing Stateside? - No. - Some high school kid - That's right. We're in sync now Jacques can you feel it? Can you? - Yeah yeah sure. - Good. 'Cause I've got a job for you tonight. No Leo. No middleman. It's ten grand. Half now half on completion. How's that sound? Sounds good. What are we doing? Meet me at the plant on Black Lake in two hours. - Is that going to be a problem? - No. No problem. Good. One more question Jacques. Leo told me all about that night at the cabin with the girls. I'm curious about the chip. How'd that happen? - It was that crazy bird. - Bird? It had a thing for Laura saying her name all the time like he's in love or something. So we're all partying. The girls are getting high everybody's crazy - You Laura and Ronnette. - Leo lets Waldo out of the cage The birdie lands on her shoulder. Laura's all tied up. Oh she liked that. The birdy starts pecking on her shoulder like love pecks. Know what I mean? So Leo he's doing a number on her and she's screaming about that damn bird. So Leo takes out a chip puts it in her mouth and says "Bite the bullet baby. " "Bite the bullet. " Thanks for clearing that up. Yeah no problem. - See you on the other side. - Can do Cappy. Got a trout on the line Hawk. This one's a keeper. - I'm just gonna sit here OK? - Come here sweetie. Look we got all night baby! Aren't you? Yeah. I'm just gonna put this Yes You made me do this Shelly. You made me! Is Lucy talking to you yet? As we say in the law enforcement game "It's a cold trail. " Ah women! Harry? Hawk here. The trout's heading upstream towards the net. Hawk hold the line. We'll set the hook. - You got a 20 on Agent Cooper? - He's downstream ten minutes. He'll probably miss the catch but he'll be there when we grill him. Copy that. We'll make our move as soon as the big fish shows his fins. Ready Andy? Ready Harry. Keep your hands where I can see them! - Put them on the roof of the car! - You heard him! Get in there and cuff him. Don't move! You 're under arrest for the attempted murder of Ronnette Pulaski and the murder of Laura Palmer. Give me your other hand. - He's got my gun! - Harry look out! Andy? - Are you OK Harry? - Yeah. - Better call that ambulance. - Yeah. held against you in a court of law you have a right to an attorney Hello? All clear. I'll be there as soon as I can. Hey what's up Doc? It's Laura in case you haven't guessed. It's Thursday 23rd and I'm so bored. Actually I'm in kind of a weird mood. God James is sweet but he's so dumb. And right now I can only take so much of sweet! Hey remember that mystery man I told you about? Well if I tell you his name then you 're going to be in trouble. He wouldn't be a mystery man anymore but you might be history man! I think a couple of times he's tried to kill me. But guess what? As you know I sure got off on it. Isn't sex weird? This guy can really light my F-l-R-E. As in red Corvette. Uh-oh! Here comes Mom with milk and cookies. - Donna? - Dad! Bye-bye. I've got an emergency at the hospital. See if your mother needs anything. I'll call later. James It's OK I'm glad I heard her say it. I'm glad. I might have gone my whole life - I'm sorry you had to hear that. - I'm OK. Jacoby didn't kill her. He was trying to help her. Then how did he get the necklace? Do you hear that? You 've got one hour to think about what you 've done to me. And think about it! 'Cause by then Bobby Briggs is gonna be dead! You broke my heart! Goodbye. It's all here. Very generous Josie. Sitting in that concrete box all that time all the money in creation. It kept me going. It's a funny thing. Back in the world I don't know it seems kind of light. We had an agreement. I've been going over this in my mind and If you could follow my thinking We're all born into life we have a certain number of years to breathe and have our being. That's from a book on Oriental philosophy I read in the joint. Maybe somebody somewhere knows how much time we have. I don't. Do you? So when a man gives up a portion of his life 18 months for instance how does he place a value on that time? What's that? 5 000 a month? Not bad if you live another 50 years but what if you 've only another 20? Or ten? Or some unforeseen event kills you tomorrow? Like the boating accident that killed your late husband Andrew. Or say you just got out of prison where you went in for vehicular manslaughter as part of an agreement to avoid being implicated in a greater crime murder for which in fact you were responsible. But now there's this threat this possible threat that this fact could be discovered. And in one stroke could be cut right out from underneath you. So I've been asking myself what does that do to the market value of 18 months? We had an agreement. And we still do sweetheart. Signed sealed delivered. And I want to take care of everything we agreed to. You want a lot for your money and I want a lot for my time. There's a saying in the joint. It's not Oriental philosophy but it has a similar logic that appeals to my spiritual nature. "Once you 're in business with somebody you 're in business for life. " Like a marriage. Partner. Damn! Where is it? Where is it? Catherine? The account ledger have you seen it? Don't you keep it in that little safe at home? It's not in the safe at home it's not anywhere! - Tell me you didn't take it. - I didn't take it. Pete tell me the truth. You 're not helping her to pull something here. - Who? - Josie. No! - Pull what here? - Oh Peter. Forget everything we've ever done to hurt each other. - Just like that! - Temporarily. Our marriage is a living train wreck but there used to be something caring between us. The fella who caught my eye. The lumberjack who could scamper up a tree like a cat. The boss's sister from that big house on the hill. A summer's indiscretion and here we are. Catherine! Oh Pete! I never should have taken you to that house on the hill. Well I have no complaints about the house. As for me taking my pleasure in lashing out at the one person who was decent enough to stand by me through all my foolishness. I know things haven't been easy for you. Peter Somewhere under all that scar tissue there's the faintest flicker of what we once felt. I'm asking you to feel that now. Why exactly? Because I'm in trouble. Given what I've become and how I've treated people there's no one else I can turn to. I need your help. Catherine! Catherine! So Fred starts to cuff him and Harry turns to go. Suddenly Jacques throws an elbow at Fred WHAM! In one move he takes Fred's gun and he's got the drop on Harry. Harry is deader than a pound of roadside stew! Then all of a sudden a single shot rings out. - Andy my man! - All right Andy! Go ahead Andy give it your best shot! Go on! Oh Andy! Oh Punky I'm pregnant. Uh-oh! Fresh coffee. - What? - Let me talk to the sheriff. The sheriff isn't in at the moment. Would you care to leave a message? You tell him Leo Johnson said to check out James Hurley. - He's an easy rider. - An easy rider? - You got that? - Yes but Leo wait! Leo! Did you take Laura and Ronnette up to your cabin that night? They'd both been up there before. They was no nuns! That's where you took the pictures for "Flesh World"? That was Laura's idea. She talked Ronnette into making them ads. What did you and Leo fight about that night? Bastard hit me with a whiskey bottle! - Why? - I don't know that's why we fought! I'm bleeding like a stuck pig and he's laughing. So you used Leo's shirt to stop the bleeding. What then? I got sick. I go outside pass out. I wake up I'm laying on the ground. - Where was Leo? - Leo and the girls they're gone. - What about the train car? - I don't know nothing about that. I come down the hill Leo's car is gone. Had to walk 15 miles back to my own house. When they brought him in he was rambling incoherently. These things he said to you they're pretty incredible. I know. Let's hope he pulls through. Well he's stabilised anyway. So Leo had to take the girls to the train car by himself? - You believe him? - He's too stupid to lie. He'll testify against Leo we got him. We got to find Leo first. - Doc how's Jacoby? - He's out of the woods. Listen he says he got a phone call from Laura Palmer. He was on his way to see her when he was jumped. - Any description of the assailant? - He didn't see him. But he says he saw Laura Palmer by the gazebo in Easter Park. It's not here! It's not here! It's not here either. Damn! Oh Midge! Midge Jones. What are you doing? It's my old high school yearbook. I thought it was gone forever. Oh Pete. Sorry. What? It's at the mill. - What is? - What you 're looking for. Drying shed three near the north gate. Pete Yes I'll look in the other room. What do you want? Talk terms. We'll let you know. Norma you still have that down comforter on your bed? Yes Hank. The mattresses they give you on your bunk they're probably this thick you know. And you lie there at night thinking "If this mattress is so skinny how did they get all those rocks inside?" So you 'll forgive me if I tell you that night after night I dreamed of you lying on that big feather bed. I guess the hired help shouldn't be so familiar with the boss lady eh? I can't blame you for dreaming. I wasn't just dreaming about being with you Norma. What I was trying to - I shouldn't be saying this much. - I think you should. No I haven't earned the right Norma. I've been back what? Two days. Say what you want to say. I've been trying to picture a whole life with you with the diner. Making it soar. Making it blue sky. I always talk too big that's my biggest fault. I learned that talking to my counsellor inside. This is new territory for me. But I'm gonna try. You know it's 20 years we've been together next month. Can you believe it? Maybe we're doing this all backwards. Maybe it's the next 20 that counts. Give me time Norma. I'll make you proud of me yet. Nadine? Nadine? Honey? Oh God! Nadine don't you do this. Nadine! I need an ambulance. My wife has just taken some pills. For the love of God hurry! Stay with me Nadine. Please don't go. Stay with me. Leo Johnson's gone to ground. I bet he's holed up near his home. - Sheriff Leo Johnson called. - When? Ten minutes ago. He left this message. And Sheriff in the background I could hear a clock striking. - What kind of clock Lucy? - Like the clock at Easter Park. - Harry! - Hawk. Good work Lucy. Pull surveillance off Leo's house. Set up a perimeter around Easter Park. - Got it. - You get some cars over there. Harry I gotta talk to you Harry let me talk to James. You want to investigate this? Come on James. Harry Harry is it true? - You 've found the killer? - We've arrested a suspect. - But is it him Harry? - I can't release any details now. I'm sorry. Excuse me. Leland there's nothing you can do here. You should be home with Sarah now. Yes you 're right. Of course you 're right. - You 're going back to the hospital? - No I'm heading home. - Thank you Will. - Don't give it a thought. Hospital I think you ought to listen to this tape. Why's that? It was Laura's. We found it. I think it'll help you find who you 're looking for. - Who might that be? - Somebody with a red Corvette. Doctor Jacoby's in hospital with a heart attack. - Heart attack? - He said he saw Laura tonight. What kind of dangerous game have you been playing? Is Jacoby gonna be all right? I've been very patient with you James. From here on out I'm gonna need a better set of answers. Let's start with why this was in the gas tank of your bike? Fine fine fine. OK. OK. Ghostwood fantastic! I love it! All your revisions are included. Ben I am so happy I can't even say how much. - After you. - No no no! After you. After me! Excuse me. Benjamin Horne here. Time to black flag that little firebug. Leo Johnson's gonna get a house call. Proceed. Shelly? Shelly are you here? - Shelly's not here Bobby. - Leo! - Am I glad to see you - Something I can help you with? It's you I was looking for. The cops are after you. Liar! Shelly's dead! You killed her! Leo! Later Leo. I can't understand a word you have a thing in your mouth. - Who are you? - Shelly Johnson. - You know who called me here? - No. Please help me. Be quiet I'm thinking. Oh God. Oh God! - Any of the boys still inside? - Not sure. Shift was over but we're still trying to get a count. - Seen Catherine? - No Pete. That's her car. Jesus God! You think she's still inside? I guess I'm gonna have to find out. Pete that ain't such a good idea. She's still my wife. Catherine! And that is that! Ben is this a great moment? - Ghostwood! - Incredible! Ghostwood eh? Einar tonight you play on the house. This is marvellous. Enjoy my friend enjoy! To Ghostwood. To Ghostwood Estates and Country Club! Congratulations Boss. Blackie old pal this calls for a celebration. Let's have a look at the new girl. Good luck honey. Close your eyes. This is such stuff as dreams are made of. Diane 4:37 am. After a long investigative night returning to the Great Northern. One suspect in custody. Leo Johnson who I believe killed Laura Palmer won't be able to escape the dragnet much longer. As you can hear from the ambient sound around me and I notice with some relief the Icelandic group on my floor have either checked or passed out I may not need the earplugs which I received today Diane although I may put them to use as a precautionary measure. I ordered hot milk from room service. Here's hoping that does the job and I can catch some quality sack time. achievement of modern civilisation. "My Special Agent". Cooper here. Who is this? Could this wait till tomorrow morning? Please excuse me I've got room service. We found him We found Leo Johnson. He's been shot. Agent Cooper?

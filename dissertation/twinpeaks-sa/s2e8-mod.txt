In fact  I dropped her off at the bus station not 20 minutes ago. - She's gone? - Yes. She thought that you were coming over last night. Did she say anything? Well  I would have to say that she was a little bit disappointed. Leland? Leland  honey? Excuse me. You know  if you'd like  you could write her. I'm sure she'd be glad to hear from you. Yeah. Look  I'm sorry we bothered you. Hey  no bother  no bother. - Say hi to your folks for me  Donna. - Okay. - Okay. - Goodbye  Mr. Palmer. Bye  James. - Take it easy now. - All right. - Leland? - Yes  dear. Remember to sign us up for the Glenn Miller Night at the club. Don't worry  dear  I won't forget. - Bye  hon. - Bye  Leland. It smells like a toilet in here. There's nothing Jerry  what the hell took you so long? Gee  datelines  time zones  I don't even know where I am. God  you look terrible. - Jerry. - Ben. Well  Ben  since your regular mouthpiece has been charged with murder himself  I'm gonna be handling your case personally. So let's get started. Did you kill her? - Jerry  for God's sakes. - Sorry  you're right. The last thing a good defense attorney needs to know is the truth. Jerry  can you get me out of here? Well  they can only hold you for 24 hours without charging you. Or is it 48? Oh  Jerry  Jerry  I am in trouble here. Under control  big brother. Okay  so where are we saying you were on the night Laura died? - I was with Catherine. - That's not a good choice. It happens to be the truth. Oh  dear. Is there any sign of her? Bone-- Bone fragments or teeth? Charred corroborating note regarding your whereabouts? I'm so depressed. Bunk beds. Do you remember our first room  Ben? Me on the top bunk and you on the bottom bunk. And Louise Dombrowski dancing on the hook rug with a flashlight. Lord  what's become of us? You know  the first time I went in  they thought it was my bladder  so they checked it again. It was an infection. I hadn't even been near a rusty nail. I mean  you remember that time my toe turned purple  right? So instead  I took a bath in baking soda and then my toe came around  but I got the worst cramps like I swallowed a kinked hose or something. Have you seen Andy? Oh  you must be that native person I've heard so much about  Eagle Eye? Hawk. Sister? Oh  yeah  this is my sister Gwen. This is Hawk. Oh  it's a pleasure to meet you. God  how you must hate us white people after all we've done to you. Some of my best friends are white people. Anyway  oh  come on. My stomach Diane  10:03 a. m.   Great Northern Hotel. Sheriff Truman and I have just been with the one-armed man  or what's left of him. In another time  another culture  he may have been a seer  a shaman priest. In our world  he's a shoe salesman and lives among the shadows. Leland Palmer. Excuse me. Does he know we arrested Ben Horne? Doesn't look like it. Harry  best if he'd hear it from you. Hi  Harry  Agent Cooper. Just having a little fun. You're looking good  Leland. Just call me Fred. Leland  I'm sorry. We didn't want you to hear it from anyone else. We've arrested Ben Horne for Laura's murder. He hasn't been charged  but we're holding him. - Ben? - That's right. There must be some mistake  Harry. Ben? - I thought that Jacques Renault had-- - No. Ben. - You have a strong case against him? - Yes  we do. Oh  God. Will you be all right  Leland? Yeah. - The law will handle this. - As it should be. Thanks  Harry. Agent Cooper. Harry  I'll catch up with you. Leland? Yes. If you can remember anything unusual about Mr. Horne's behavior the night of Laura's death  would you please let me know? I will  of course. Thank you. Everything okay? I'm not sure. This won't hurt a bit. Sheriff  I protest this brutal treatment of my client. After all this man has done for this town Now  hold still. I'll have the results in a couple of hours. - Thanks  doc. - Gentlemen  I demand that my client either be released or charged. Never in all my years of practicing law have I witnessed such a complete and utter disregard for an accused man's constitutional rights. Jeremy Horne  Gonzaga University  1974. Graduated last in his class of 142. Passed the bar on his third attempt. License to practice revoked in the states of Illinois  Florida  Alaska  Massachusetts. Hey  I'm not on trial here. Sit down. Mr. Horne  do you know what this is? - A book. - A book. Take a closer look. A diary. We all know about One-Eyed Jack's. So did Laura. ""Someday  I'm gonna tell the world all about Ben Horne. I'm gonna tell them who he really is. "" She never got the chance  did she? Come on  Ben  we're all adults here. Wild  young girl like Laura Palmer  things spin out of control. She becomes a threat not just to you  but to your business  your family. You are way out of line. Well  maybe you don't have anything to hide. That's not what it says in here. - You cannot talk to me like this! - Ben. Ben. - You cannot  you understand? - Sit down. Nice and easy. Gentlemen  I'd like a moment alone with my brother-- With my client. If you don't mind? You have your moment. Ben  Ben. Ben  if you're gonna blurt out a confession like that  it's gonna make our options shrink down to a tiny little nub. All right  what are we gonna do? What are we gonna do? Your alibi has been roasted. They can establish motive. And your blood may have Laura's fingerprints on it. Ben  as your attorney  your friend  and your brother  I strongly suggest that you get yourself a better lawyer. Okay  one last chance  Leo. Don't disappoint me. The mill? Okay  one last chance  Leo. Don't disappoint me. The mill? Keep it simple. Insurance investigators should read ""arson. "" Block letters about 6 feet high. The deal as we discussed? Ben Horne  his voice  and Johnson's voice  Ben and Leo. Special delivery for Mr. Horne. Bobby. Oh  God. Bobby! He did it again. It's your turn to clean him this time. What's that? That is our ship. What's that mean? Since our cash cow in the other room has turned into a sinkhole  I've decided to pursue a career in business. Really? Like a salesman? Oh  no  I'm thinking more executive suite. - Really? - Yeah. Bobby  that sounds great. I'm gonna give you anything you want. I want a full-time nanny. - Maybe a French maid. - Bobby. - Hello  Norma. - Mother. I trust those are real potatoes and not flakes? Real potatoes. Excuse me. What a nice surprise to see you here. Hey  those are good. I see they taught him a skill in the stockade. - Where is your charming husband? - Hank? He's not here right now. I see. Mother  I got your message. But if you don't mind my asking  what are you doing here? I want to introduce you to my new husband. Husband? Ernie  this is Norma. Hi  how are you? We're honeymooning. I wonder if I could bother you for a cup of coffee? - Nice girl. - She's darling. Ernie's a financial analyst. I just love what you've done with your diner  darling. The flowers add such a measure of cheer. Oh  thank you. Thank you so much. Nice to see those good looks haven't isolated themselves to one generation. - Yeah  I know  go with gold figures. - Excuse me. You still look very smart in that uniform. Your figure's lovely. It hasn't changed. Now  I don't mean to be rude  but how long will you be staying? A couple of days. Ernie wanted to see something of the country. Why? I just wish I had known  that's all. Oh  I didn't mean for you to go into any fuss. You know me  dear  I'm easy. What's wrong? Nothing  it's just that there's a food critic coming and I'm short on help  that's all. Food critic. So that's why you tried so hard to make the place look nice. Norma  hoping to spend much more time with you. If it's all right  we'd better check in. I've got a Tokyo fax waiting for me at the desk. We'll be at the Great Northern. I'm sorry we missed Henry. I'll call you later  okay? Okay. Nice to meet you. He's close. Nurse. Could I have a glass of water  please? Yes  sir. I'm sorry. Hi  Norma. I guess I'm a little late. Forty-eight hours is not late  Hank  it's missing. I'm sorry  it was some-- Some business I had to take care of. Business? No  this is business. Business is a place where you come to whether you feel like it or not. - Norma  l-- - Don't sweet-talk me  I'm this far from telling you to take a hike. Norma  please don't make that kind of judgment until you hear me out. Because of the bad choices I've made  there are people out there  people from my past who wanna see me fail. I've tried fighting them  but I just get in more trouble. I've tried running from them  but there's always somebody faster. I know it's no way for a man to live his life  but sometimes it's just best to hold up and wait for the storm to pass. I didn't mean to hurt you. I'm just trying to keep my head above water. Maybe next time  you'll ask for a little help. Next time  I will. Well  the prodigal son returns. - Vivian. - Hi. - You look great. - Thanks. Prison treat you well? Well  that's a long story. I'd like to hear it over dinner tonight. I have a new husband. - Great Northern  8:30? - We'd love to. - I don't think if I'll be able to get there. - We'll be fine  honey. Eight-thirty sharp  we'll be there. - Harry? - Oh  hello  Pete. What you got? Woodpecker. Pileated  I think. Yeah. Here. Pileated woodpecker. Outstanding. Harry? Yeah  Pete. Harry  Josie's gone. Yeah  I know. When I came home from the late shift  she left a note on the kitchen table  no explanations  no goodbyes. A note. She sold the mill to Ben Horne. Well  not exactly. You don't have to explain. I loved her. There. I said it. No offense  Harry. I loved her too. I stood there and watched her go. Watched her assistant carry her bags away. Her assistant? Yeah  Asian fellow. Never saw him before. What did he look like? Average height  medium build  ponytail. Oh  that was her cousin  Jonathan. She said it was her assistant  Mr. Lee. Mr. Lee? Harry  I have a bad feeling. - I'm right there with you  Pete. - Harry. Hello  Pete. Gerard's missing. He knocked the deputy out. Pete  you'll have to excuse us. He don't get far. Hi  sheriff. Agent Cooper. Lucy? - Lucy? - What? Andy? Step right in  Pete. We desperate criminals are locked safely in our cages. I have a message for you. Greetings from the boys down at the mill? But first  a little music. Hello  Benjamin. Oh  I'm sorry I haven't dropped by for a visit  dear. But I have a strong aversion to prisons. - How awful-- - She's alive? The night we spent together lost in love. When was that? It seems so long ago. Almost like a dream. Oh  yes  I remember  it was the night Laura Palmer died. Memory is so unreliable finally  maybe it was a dream. Maybe it never happened. To tell you the truth  I can't be sure anymore. What does she want? I'll pay anything. What does she want? You okay there  Benji? In exchange for my testimony  dear  you will sign the mill and Ghostwood Estates back over to me. I will consider letting you keep your precious hotel. A representative of mine will come to you with the documents within 24 hours. If you won't cooperate Well  I'm confident that you'll go on from here to excel in one or another of the many fine career opportunities offered by the federal prison system. Ben  so nice to see you again. She set me up. That Catherine. She set me up. She's a cautioned  isn't she? You set me up! You bitch! You bitch! I'll get you  you bitch. Set me up. Set me up. Chicks and ducks and geese Better scurry When I take you out in the surrey When I take you out in the surrey With the fringe on top When I take you out in the surrey When I take you out in the surrey With the fringe on top Harry  are driver education programs mandatory in your school system? Yep. I think we got a dropout. Harry  look out. With the fringe on top Leland. Agent Cooper  Harry  I'm sorry. - Are you two all right? - Leland  we're fine. How about you? Oh  sure  I'm fine  I'm fine. I was just on my way to the club to try out a new set of irons  and I must have started thinking about Ben. I guess my mind just wandered. It's a good idea to leave your troubles at home when operating a vehicle. You're right  of course. My apologies. I did remember something  as you asked  about the night Laura died. I was working late at the office with Ben  it was about 10:00. He left the room to make a phone call. I don't know who he was talking to  but his voice was raised  he was angry. I heard him mention something about a dairy. - A dairy? - That's what I think  yes. - A diary. - That could be it. Sheriff Truman  Sheriff Truman  this is Lucy. Are you there  sheriff? I have an urgent message from Hawk. - Do you play golf  Agent Cooper? - Yes  Leland  I enjoy its precision. I'd like to invite you for a round at the club someday. May I show you my new clubs? Sure. Cooper. They found Gerard. Near the waterfall. Better go. They're waiting for us. Let's go get him. Leland  we'll see those clubs another time. I understand  Agent Cooper. You let me know - if there's anything I can do to help. - Will do. Poor Andy. You know  the exact same thing happened to me when I first got pregnant. I would be out shopping  and then boom  pass right out in the produce section. Then come to covered in bruises and crushed fruit  and strangers standing over me waiting to see if I was dead. You see  people want terrible things to happen to you  I know. I wanna talk to you about my sperms. Sperms? You know  that is all men think about. You know  I remember when little Carl was first born and they laid him out on my breast  I looked down and saw what kind of a tiny little creature I was dealing with. And I thought to myself  I thought  ""My God  just what the world needs  another sperm gun running around loose. Right? Women beware. "" Well  I did. I had mine counted twice. The first time  they were all dead. Oh  man  if I had a nickel every time I heard that one. - Second time  they were jumping like-- - What? What? --Like salmon swimming upstream. So  of course  all you could think of was spawning. - Shut up. - Shut up  Gwen. So when you told me that you were pregnant  I didn't think it could be me because mine were all dead supposedly at the time. But they got better. I was misinformed. I'm the father. Oh  brother. Aren't I? Oh  yeah. Oh  come here. You want to see your mean Aunt Lucy. Oh  aren't you neat  you little snooky-bookems. He's been close. Bob is not here now. Sheriff. Sheriff? Isn't there something that you'd like to share with us? Oh  great. And would you tell this guy to stop staring at me like I'm a dog biscuit. Bob has been very close. Who's Bob? I don't know a Bob. Do we know a Bob? Sheriff  no offense  but clearly  this man's stairs do not reach the attic. Now  your 24 hours are up. You either charge my client or let him go! Ben Horne  I'm charging you with the murder of Laura Palmer. Yeah. Good move  Jer. Hawk  take Mr. Gerard back to the hotel. - Nail all the windows shut. - No. No. - I want two men on the door. - You two-bit lumberjack. - You are finished in this town. - Don't make it worse. You're finished. - Calm down. What are you doing? - Step outside  please? I'm all right. Harry. Harry  I think we're saddling the horse before we're ready to ride. I don't follow. I don't think Ben Horne killed Laura Palmer. - What? - You should release him. Cooper? I've backed you every step of the way. I've had enough of the mumbo jumbo. I've had enough of the dreams  the visions  the dwarfs  the giants  Tibet and the rest of the hocus-pocus. Now  we've got hard evidence against Ben Horne. It's my job to lock him up. You're right  Harry. This is your back yard. Sometimes an outsider can forget that. Well  the salmon was fresh and firm and just a little bit overdone. - Mine too. - Just right. Would you excuse me for a minute  please? I'll join you. Ladies  hurry back. You're not gonna say anything  are you? If Vivian ever found out I'd been inside she'd-- She'd drop me flat. I like your new hair color. Ernie Niles. Ernie ""The Professor"" Niles. - So when did you? - A couple of weeks ago. Let me tell you  Ernie  without you in there to pal around with the last six months were sheer hell. Nobody to go to the library with. Nobody to stamp out license plates with. So  what's your angle here with Miss Moneybags? No angle. Come on  buddy  we don't have any secrets. Vivian's rolling in dough. I met Vivian at a Republican fundraiser. We're married. You must have told her some tall tale  a whopper. I'm trying very hard to tell nothing but the truth these days. It's therapeutic. And Vivian wants me to handle all her investments. What about yours? Introduce her to your loan shark? I'm out of it  I'm out of it  Hank. I don't gamble anymore. I go to meetings. I go to church too. So  what happens when Vivian finds out that you ran off - with the congregation's picnic fund? - I never stole from a church. It was a savings and loan. I was sick  it was an illness. I paid my debt. It's a new life  a clean-- Clean slate. - So she really doesn't know? - No. Well  Ernie  this is interesting to me. Because family is the most important thing in the world to me. One must be prepared to pay any price to protect it. Don't you agree? Oh  yeah  yeah. I completely agree. We'll talk more later  Ernie. I've always enjoyed our talks in the yard  man-to-man  prisoner-to-prisoner. - We're back. - Ladies. I would like to propose a toast to the newlyweds and their happiness. Thank you  Henry. It's very generous. To Ernie and Vivian  to much success in their future and all their future dealings. How sweet. That's sweet. Diane  it's 11:05 p. m. I'm in my room at the Great Northern Hotel. There's not a star in the sky tonight. Ben Horne is in custody. The trail narrows  Diane. I'm very close  but the last few steps are always the darkest and most difficult. - Hi. - Audrey? - Can I come in and talk? - All right. - Is that where you got shot? - Yeah. Did you arrest him? Yeah. Did he do it? That's for a court to decide. What do you think? What I think doesn't really matter right now. Did you arrest him because of what I said? Only in part. But it helped? Yeah. All I ever really wanted was for him to love me. I'm sure that he does. He's ashamed of me. No  he's not. Agent Cooper  when I was at One-Eyed Jack's  I never  never let anyone-- Audrey  you don't have to say anything. I want you to know. I know. I have to get that. Okay. Cooper here. Where? How long ago? - I'm on my way. - What's wrong? I want you to go to your room and lock the door. - Why? - No questions  do what I say. All right. It's Maddy Ferguson."

"13","I remember stepping from the flames  a vague shape in the dark  then nothing. Until I found myself standing by the cold remains of our campfire two days later. Major  there are some new techniques that might help us break through your amnesia. My memories are immune from regression. I can feel them  they are palpable  the smells and sensation. Everything is known to me  yet somehow beyond my reach. Do you remember anything else? Very little. Save for one disturbing image of a giant owl. - Pervasive. - A giant owl? A giant owl? How big? Enough to cloud my mind and memory. Three triangular scars behind the right ear in perfect proportion. Major Briggs  exactly what does your work involve? That information's  as I've repeated endlessly to myself  classified. Though the keeping of secrets seems less meaningful to me now. Perhaps there are sources of information that are so important as to transcend the human need to conspire. Information of such weight  that pertains not-- Oh  God. Is this meant for the soul? My soul? Major  perhaps you'd better start back at the beginning. Are you familiar with Project Blue Book? Yes  sir  I am. The Air Force investigation into the phenomena of unidentified flying objects. Officially disbanded in 1969. But there are those of us who continue  in an unofficial capacity  examining the heavens as before. In the case of Twin Peaks  the earth below. We are searching for a place called the White Lodge. - Major Briggs? - I've been expecting you. - Hold on just a minute  fellows. - Colonel Riley's orders. I don't care what orders you've got  this is my station and Major Briggs happens to be a friend of-- Harry. I'm afraid we will have to continue this discussion at a later date. Are you sure you wanna go with them? Yeah. - Goodbye. - Major. Oh  go ahead  Ernie  it won't bite. A lot you know  pal. These men are dangerous thugs  not that I haven't met plenty of their kind before. Jean Renault is a hard man  but I've known men that would make him quiver. Ernie  come on. Make the call. Well  have we set the buy yet? Trying to. Ernie's a wee bit gun-shy. Gun-shy? Ernie Niles is as bold as can be. Let me at him. Please don't make me do this. This is suicide  I know. Please  I'm begging you  please. For everybody's sake  please. Ernie  Ernie  Ernie. Hello. May I speak to Jean Renault  please? Hi  Jean. Yeah  I've got that big out-of-town buy here. Hi  Lucy. Where have you been  Andrew? There was a cat in a tree. A peace officer's work is never done. But fortunately for us  my efforts have borne more palatable fruit. I paid the Happy Helping Hand adoption agency a visit  where several blue-haired ladies were only too happy to sup from my open palm. Unfortunately  little Nicky's records have been sealed and returned to the orphanage. We'll never know what really happened to little Nicky's parents. Courage  Andrew. Do not despair  dear boy. Next stop  that selfsame orphanage. And little Nicky's records within. - Maybe we should tell Lucy. - Absolutely not. This  dear boy  is strictly a man's job. Follow me. - Lucy. - Hi. Any luck? I checked the personals columns in every national newspaper on the list  and I didn't see anything that looked like a chess deal or find any mention of the name Windom Earle. I'm sorry. It's okay. More coffee? You bet. Is everything all right  Ed? Couldn't be better. This is for you. Bye for now. Bye-bye. Come on  Leo. That's a good Leo. Each day brings a new beginning. And every hour  the promise of It was your turn to feed him  Bobby! I got practice. Football season is over. Baseball. Our national pastime? Fine. You can clean when you get back. I ain't coming back. What? You're looking at Ben Horne's brand-new boy. Do the words ""golden opportunity"" mean anything to you? This is my big break  Shelly. You don't think I have anything better to do than give Leo Johnson a bubble bath? And what about me  Bobby? Do I not have anything better to do? Not that I can think of. Bobby. Bobby! Bobby! God! Big Ed's Gas Farm. - Uncle Ed? - James? - Yeah  it's me. - Where are you? Are you all right? Oh  I'm okay. Look  I need a favor. I need you to get all the money out of my savings account. That's only $ 12  James. Well  whatever's left. And send it care of me to Wallies. It's this bar out on 96. Are you in trouble? No  I really can't talk about it. - James-- - Listen  I really can't talk right now. - Okay. - We'll talk about it soon. - Take care. - Yeah. - Call soon. - Okay  bye. - Long-distance? - Twin Peaks. Are you homesick  James? No. Tell me about Twin Peaks. There's nothing to say. You could start with why you left. It was a woman  as I recall. No  you said it was a few of them. I loved a girl who died. Her name was Laura. And I thought I knew her  but I didn't. I guess nobody did. I'm sorry. My life used to make sense  you know? I didn't like it all the time  but it was mine. And I felt like it belonged to me. And then Laura died. And now I belong to something else. To Laura. And no matter what I did  or how much I tried to help another girl got murdered. I just wanted to get on my bike and ride away. Take off  just go as far from Twin Peaks as the thing will take me. I know the feeling  James. I know the feeling. Why do you let him hurt you? Jeffrey's leaving. I need you. Will you help me? - Mr. Marsh. - What do you mean? - I need your help. - I'll put the bags in for you. Very good  sir. - Good morning  Mike Nelson. - Oh  Lord. You wanna share a soda? How about a nice big piece of cherry pie? Two forks. Mrs. Hurley  Nadine  I want my own piece of cherry pie. In fact  I want two pieces of cherry pie  by myself. Okay. Meat loaf. No. Cherry pie and coffee. In fact  I want 16 cups of coffee. I don't wanna talk with you  walk with you. I don't wanna see you  I don't wanna know you. Is that clear enough to understand? Or do I need a court order to get my point across? Mike Nelson  you are the handsomest boy I've ever known. And I would really like it if you and I could go out on a date. I'm sorry. Sometimes I can't help myself. Hey  Norma. Where are you going? I have to run some errands. It's a little early for errands  isn't it? We've still got most of the breakfast crowd. Just you and a kitchen full of scrambled eggs. I'll be right back. Just think of it as a test  Hank. I'll do that. I thought you were moving into my place. - I'm sorry. - What happened? What the hell are you doing here? - This is my home. - Home? After everything Catherine has done to you? I have no choice. Josie. Josie. - Oh  go home. - Josie  let me take care of you. - No. - Please. Listen  I'm safe here. And when I'm here  - you're safe too. - No. Stop. Look at me. I'm Catherine's maid. I'm no good for you. You are good for me. I love you. I want you. Lucille What? What's wrong? Yes  sir  general. I want you to lead the charge on Little Round Top. Yes  sir. Yes  sir! And where is General Stuart? And his cavalry? He's a-coming  sir. Damn his eyes. - He's coming  sir. I know it! - Daddy! - He's coming. He had better be. - Daddy. For all our sakes. Because the enemy  we meet the enemy here. We meet him before morning. - We meet him here. - Daddy. Yes  darling? What are you doing? There's a war going on  darling. A war? A war between the states. Daddy  I think you need some help. No  no  I'm all right  darling. I just need a little time. This is a very important day. Yes  Daddy  this is a very important day. We're gonna save the business. - You and I. - Darling  darling. Yes  Daddy? You are standing on General Stuart. General Lee! General Lee! Yes  sir. Old Jeb  he's come. Oh  I don't need any more wagons! I want my eyes and my ears beside me. - Get me General Stuart. - This is Audrey. - I need you to get me Jerry Horne. - Bring me General Norton. - Ready the men of the Alabama 15th. - This is an emergency. - I've been figuring that we have to-- - I think we need to talk about what-- Come on in. You first. Okay. You're the last thing I think of when I go to sleep at night. And you're the first thought on my mind when I get up in the morning. I know this world is going to pieces  and it feels like it's designed to keep us apart. But we love each other  Ed. I wanna be with you. I wanna be with you no matter what happens. Ed  Ed  Ed. Your turn. Later. Will you mind the chest hair  will you? You're sweating like a pig  Mr. Niles. Oh  thanks a lot. That's nervous perspiration  man. Hyperhidrosis. It's a childhood condition. I didn't notice it till the war. Korea  remember that year? I was leading a battalion up towards the 49th parallel. We were just a bunch of fresh-faced kids. I didn't know what kind of hell we were stepping into. Ernie. Ernie  I want you to focus on the here and now. Repeat your instructions to me step by step. Okay. I take Denise up to Dead Dog Farm. - I introduce her to Renault. - Right. I take Renault through the buy  complete the transaction and get the hell out of there. Good. Harry? That's when you come in. By golly  I sure wish I could join you fellas. But I've temporarily lost my enforcement franchise. - I'll bet. - Well  I've been giving that some thought. Consider yourself deputized. The Bureau's loss is my gain. I hope I can live up to this. He's done. You might wanna towel him off before we go. Come on. How long will it take you guys to storm the farmhouse after I complete the buy? You go out  we come in. - Can I ask you a question? - What  Ernie? Don't make me do this. This isn't my line of work. I'm a coward. I don't do this kind of thing  I'm a CPA. - Ernie. - Ernie. Just a momentary lapse. Look  I'm cool. Let's go do it  huh? - Where's Denise? - I haven't seen her. You can call me Dennis. Oh  I don't know  somehow it seemed more appropriate. What do you think? Our investigation must proceed sub rosa. We may have to pick the lock. Tricky business. Voila. We enter. - Where is everybody? - Lunch. Here we are  the case files. N  N. N  N ! Nails  Neaster  Neatherby  Needleman. Nicholas Needleman  our little Nicky. - We can read it in the car. - Patience  Andrew. - Dick. - The usual background information. Birthplace  initial adoption. First of several  it seems. Dick. The plot thickens. Where are thy secrets  little Nicky? Dick. Hi. We're the Brunstons. I know we're a little early. It's just that we're so darn eager to see him. Can we see him? Where is Donnie? Little Donnie is dead. Dead tired  I mean. I'm afraid little Donnie  he isn't feeling up to snuff. Well  he was in perfect health only yesterday. - Dick. - Just a minute. Woody  let me finish helping these good people. Now  where were we? Ed. Ed  it's Donna. - I need your help  Ed. - What can I do for you  honey? Well  I've been looking for James. He hasn't been in school  no one's seen him at the diner. I even went by his house  but I can't find him. Listen  James is fine. He called. He asked me to send him some money in care of a bar out on 96. We didn't talk long. - It's all I know. - I'll take it to him. Well  what about your folks? I'll explain  they'll understand. - Okay. - Thanks  Ed. I have to get going. I'll call. - We have a lot to talk about. - Yeah. - Bye. - Bye. Oh  Ed. The things we do for love. Eddie  I'm home. Eddie! Look out! You big bully! Eddie? Can you hear me? - Nadine? - Yeah  Nadine's here. Don't you worry about a thing  baby. Nadine will take care of everything. Colonel Chamberlain and the 20th Maine were trapped at the summit of Little Round Top. Now  his only chance is to maneuver his left flank down the hillside like a swinging gate. But we were waiting for him  Bobby. And Chamberlain's desperate maneuver ended  Bobby  in failure. - Mr. Horne-- - Little Round Top  Bobby  was ours. From that vantage point  we were able to roll back the Federal lines. Setting the stage for Pickett's mighty charge  Bobby. And victory! Victory. Hurray. General Meade  you have suffered an ignoble defeat. And I accept your unconditional surrender. Okay  tell you what  Mr. Horne. I'm gonna go and talk to President Lincoln first  okay? So you just wait right here and And I'll get back to you on this whole surrender thing. Okay? Gotta go. Don't wanna keep the president waiting. Sir! Baby  I got some good news and I got some bad news. The bad news is that your old man just bought a condo in Flip City. The good news is that he's about to win the Civil War. I know. Uncle Jerry said he was coming home on the next plane. Dr. Jacoby said he would come over tomorrow. I think Daddy needs an injection. God  we gotta help him. Don't worry  baby  Bobby's on the case. Don't call me baby. Enter lively. Catherine. Hello  Ben. You've come here to gloat  haven't you? To celebrate my demise. Well  you go ahead. You laugh. You defeated me as I have defeated General Meade. It's true. I did come here to gloat. You double-crossed me. You tried to kill me. And I wanted to bury you so deeply that future generations would unearth and exhibit your remains. Slimy rat bastard Americanus. Do not feed. Do not trust. I suppose that I'm not that trustworthy. Despite everything I know about you  I find myself here with you. Wanting you. You can't be serious. I want you  Ben. Horrifying as it seems  I can't escape it. You You make my body hum. Kiss me  General Lee. On to victory! Hurry up  Jim. The champagne's getting warm. Don't call me Jim. All right  all right  all right. - James  what? - You may look! Any place you wanna go? Jeffrey will be home by midnight. Doesn't leave us a lot of time. Well  I'll take what we can get. It's a deal. To handsome strangers. And rebuilt engines. You know  I never thought I'd see it drive again. You're a miracle worker. No  honest. You're being too modest. Oh  go on. You deserve it. You're strong and you're kind. You have a wonderfully honest face  James. Don't laugh  it's quite rare. Every time I look at you  I could tell exactly what you're thinking. Well  I'd better be careful about what I'm thinking. Don't be too careful. Not on my account. So  what are your plans? I don't really have any plans. Where will you go? I don't know. - James  don't. - What? I don't want you to leave. Give me some more time  James. I can think of a hundred reasons for you to stay. You sure you don't wanna wait for Hank? He told me this morning he wanted in on all of this. - I think we should wait-- - We'll start without him. Whatever you say. You're sweating. Is something wrong? Sweaty. You know  it's hyperhidrosis. It's a childhood condition. I was living in Guam at the time I contracted yellow fever. The effects are vicious. You know  sweating is one of the more socially unacceptable. Sit down  Ernie. Take a deep breath. - Socially unacceptable. - Everything seems to be in order. Do you think we could hurry this up? I got a plane to catch. Jean. Jean  take a look  his shirt is smoking. The wire's dead. Cooper! - Cooper! - Coop. He came for me  Harry. I want safe passage to the border. First  release the hostages. We're at cross-purposes  Cooper. We'll kill you if you don't. Then everybody dies. No  we'll trade. Trade? Ernie Niles and agent Bryson for me. Coop. - I want backup. - State police? Call them in. Lucy  it's Hawk. Patch me through to the state police. How's our baby boy? Sound asleep. Dreaming of love. Lucky  lucky  lucky boy. Lucky  lucky  lucky. They moved him to the center room. Andy  keep steady. More deputies. Sharpshooters. Let's deal or let's run. Will they let us run  Agent Cooper? No. So you think they will deal? No. What do you suggest we do? Surrender. Okay. Are you crazy? No. But first  we must decide to give up quietly or to kill him. - Then we both die. - I know. Is my death so important to you? My two brothers died. I hold you responsible. Why? Before you came here  Twin Peaks was a simple place. My brothers deal dope to the teenagers and the truck drivers. One-Eyed Jack's welcomed the businessmen and the tourists. Quiet people lived a quiet life. Then  a pretty girl die  and you arrive  and everything change. My brother Bernard  shot and left to die in the woods. A grieving father smother my remaining brother with a pillow. Kidnapping. Death. Suddenly  the quiet people  they're quiet no more. Suddenly  the simple dream become the nightmare. So if you die  maybe you will be the last to die. Maybe you brought the nightmare with you. And maybe the nightmare will die with you. I don't know what the hell you're talking about. But I do know we've got a damn problem here. And if you're not gonna solve it  I will. - Jean. - What? Take a look at this. - You order any food? - No. No  no  no  let her come. Let her come. It's just a girl. - Hello. - Suppertime. Don't I know you? Are you okay? Yeah. Quick thinking  Denise. It was just my legs. Thank Sheriff Truman. It was his idea. Harry S. Truman. Sometimes you gotta improvise. He's dead. Bobby? Bobby? Bobby  this isn't funny. Bobby? Leo? Shelly. - Bomb. What do you mean  bomb? - Start at the beginning. Well  the voice on the phone said that there was a bomb planted in the woods  but it didn't say which woods. Then all of a sudden  there was this huge explosion and all the lights went out. So then I called the fire department. - Good work  Lucy. - Was there a fire? Two of them. First there was one at the power station. But most of the volunteer fire department-- I'm gonna go check on the generator. Something's not right. Okay. So? --Were playing bingo  so it took a while to get everybody together. - Excuse me  Lucy. - Then there was the explosion I told you about  which sounded like it was right upstairs  so we all got out of here. Well  it turned out to be a transformer on the pole right behind and above the building. Well  we had to wait to go back inside because it was shooting sparks everywhere and we were afraid that the station was gonna catch on fire too. - But it didn't. - Do they know how it started? Suspicious in nature  that's what Chief Kipple said. He was suffering from smoke inhalation at the time  so he sounded a little hoarse. You should hear his cough. I'm gonna make him some chicken soup. - Harry? - Yeah  Coop. You'd better take a look at this  alone. Lucy  wait here. Good Lord. Who is it? I don't know. It's a chess game. Windom Earle's next move."

"18","Do you like that? Oh  Harry. Josie. Yes. Yes  it's me. I'm here. - Josie. - Harry  I'm here. Josie Room service. Come on in  it's open. You can just put it on the table. Audrey. I trust your sleep was untroubled? Here at The Great Northern  we aim to make your stay as comfortable and as enjoyable as possible. You know  we take the concept of room service very seriously. Do you remember your grandfather? Colorful man  one of the wisest I ever met. You know what he once said? He said if you're gonna bring a hammer  you better bring nails. What's that supposed to mean? What that means is the next time you come into my room and carry on  you'd better be ready to finish whatever it is you came here to start. - Maybe I'm ready now. - Then be yourself. I am being myself. You're right. You're absolutely right. I stand corrected  you're a beautiful  intelligent young woman. What else? You have an undeniable magic about you that inspires a plan. Flight at sunset and dinner for two? - When? - What  the flight or the sunset? Well  I have to go to the library and have a meeting with my father later. A simple yes or no would do. Yes. And if you bring a hammer  you better bring some nails too. Anything? No  not a word. She wants to speak to the South African consulate. In Twin Peaks? Why would Eckhardt want me dead? Sexual jealousy. Oh  yeah. It's good to have you back  Harry. Taken me a day or so to get my sea legs. Well  to be honest  it looks like you went down with the ship. Why don't you go home and recuperate? No  all I need is some coffee  maybe a little food. Sure-fire cure for a hangover  Harry. You take a glass of nearly frozen  unstrained tomato juice. You plop a couple of oysters in there  you drink it down. Breathe deeply. Next  you take a mound  and I mean a mound  of sweetbreads  sautï¿½ them with some chestnuts and some Canadian bacon. Finally  biscuits. Big biscuits  smothered in gravy. Now  here's where it gets tricky  you're gonna need some anchovies-- Excuse me. That should do it. The bonsai. The ultimate miniature. Bicarbonate of soda  the ultimate digestive aid. Harry  quaff in good health. Thank you. Where the hell did that come from? It was delivered this morning. It's from Josie. Harry  Windom Earle was at my house. Windom Earle. When? Yesterday. He left this with Donna. He's closing in  Harry. Knight to king bishop 3. What do we do? We publish our next move today. Thanks  Lucy. Brace yourself  Harry. - Agent Dale Cooper. - Gordon Cole. Sure sorry to interrupt you fellas. But  Coop  I'm bringing you the classified portion of the Windom Earle dossier. Back from Bend? Been on over to Bend  Oregon. Whole lot of shaking going on down in Bend. Enter Gordon Cole. This is so galling  Leo. Young Dale is continually refusing to play fair! When Earle went: The doctors discovered he was on haloperidol. The same drug the one-armed man  Gerard  was on. - What's that? - Gerard used the same drug. You got it. But they figured he was using the drug to fake his illness just as you suspected  Coop. Definite schizoid maneuvering. ""Project Blue Book?"" My God  Gordon  what was he doing on this? The Bureau loaned Earle out to the Air Force in 1965. Reports on his two-year hitch are blacked out. National security. Wait a minute. Earle was investigating UFOs? Major Briggs  Harry. Gordon  there are some curious linkages here. The word linkage reminds me of sausage. Never cared much for the links  preferred the patties. But breakfast is a real good idea. Bonsai. Remember those old World War II movies? Bonsai! Damnation! Good to see you again  doc. Sheriff  we'll be riding with you. Cruiser's right outside. Hold it one second there  Coop. You'd better dust off your own black suit. With Windom Earle rolling around loose on the deck  we need you back on the team. What are you saying  Gordon? Coop  it gives me great pleasure to reinstate you into the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Brand-new issue  more accurate and efficient. Smith & Wesson  ten millimeter. Model 1076  all stainless steel. It's a beautiful weapon  Coop  and it's all yours. Thank you  Gordon. Cooper  we're gonna find Earle. We will pursue  - capture and incarcerate. - Capture and incarcerate. Let's hit the road. Come on  buster  I'm buying. On your tail  Gordon. Now  Leo pick three cards. One  two  three. Queen Donna. Queen Audrey. Queen Shelly  good. Now  see if you can find the king. Little Dale. Now  we need one more queen. Let's see. The queen of hearts. Let me see. Miss Twin Peaks. Now  what do you get if you win? You get a dozen roses  a scholarship to the college of your choice  the accolades of your peers Oh  yes  I know. You get to die. A royal execution. And Cooper gets to watch. Hello  Ben. I need to talk to you. How was everything  sir? Unbelievable. - Is Audrey Horne here? - She's in the back. I'll get her for you. Thanks. Donna  hi. Hi  Donna. Hi. - Hi  Donna. - Hi. - Can I talk to you for a minute? - Sure. This might sound a little strange. What? Would you know any reason why my mom's visiting your dad? Not offhand. Okay  well  yesterday  he came by the house to see my mom. And today  she drove over here to see him. Maybe she's just helping him with the Stop Ghostwood campaign. No  she would have said something to me  and she hasn't said a word. Is she here now? They're in his office together. No  I won't accept them. They're your letters. They were written to you. I don't want them. I won't have them in my house any longer. You've had them for 20 years. Why now? That's just what I'm asking you. Why now? They'll only succeed in ripping apart old wounds. I can't bear the thought of it. Eileen. Eileen  why don't you believe me? Words aren't good enough. I want my actions to speak for me. Haven't you been listening? I have been wrong all these years. I am trying to make up for it. Sometimes  making up for things only makes it worse. Oh  Eileen. You should have been the best thing that ever happened to me. Ben  please. I haven't held you since that night. Don't. Oh  I wanna hold you. I wanna go back. - God  if you'd just-- - Please  don't! I'm sorry. - Have you told her? - God  no. Never. I never will. And you must promise me the same. You mustn't come over again. You must stay away from her. I understand. I hope you do. What the hell was that all about? I don't know. But I'm gonna find out. Harry  the best cure I ever came across for a hangover was raw meat  and plenty of it. You break an egg on it. Add in some salted anchovies  Tabasco and Worcestershire sauce. If you want  we can order up some for you. Now that I come to mention it  Coop  you know what I'm in the mood for? What's that  Gordon? A steak so rare  you could sell it at Tiffany's. Well  you've come to the right place. Good deal. Holy smokes  who is that? Shelly Johnson. Shelly Johnson. What a beauty. Kind of reminds me of that statue  the babe without the arms. - Venus de Milo. - The name was Milo  but that's beside the point. That's the kind of girl to make you wish you spoke a little French. Excuse me  Coop  while I try my hand at a little counter Esperanto. Good luck  Gordon. Hello. I was wondering if I might trouble you for a cup of strong  black coffee. And in the process  engage you with an anecdote of no small amusement. The name is Gordon Cole  and I couldn't help but notice you from the booth. Andwell  seeing your beauty now  I feel as though my stomach is filled with a team of bumblebees. You don't have to shout  I can hear you. I heard that. I heard that. Do you want anything besides coffee? I heard you perfectly. And I can hear you  honest  please-- You don't understand. You don't understand  Miss Johnson. Do you see these? For 20 years  I've been asking people to please speak up  but for some weird reason  I can hear you clear as a bell. Say something else. Do you want pie with your coffee? Good Lord. I can hear you perfectly. This is like some kind of miracle. A phenomenon. - What's wrong with miracles? - What's that? This cherry pie is a miracle. Would you please ask the lady with the log to speak up? The pie  she was talking about the cherry pie. I heard you again. I heard you again. Would you like some pie? Massive  massive quantities. And a glass of water  sweetheart  my socks are on fire. Harry. That looks like a chickadee on a Dodge Dart. No  it looks like a finch on a Dodge Dart. Nope  chickadee on a Dodge Dart. - Hi. - Hi. Cup of deep black joe? You bet. What do you recommend for a hangover? Teetotaling and prayer. Good answer. I'll try some coffee. How are you today? I'm fine. I'm weird  actually. I'm disoriented  I'm not sure where I am. I mean  I know where I am  but it feels odd being here. I'm okay. Okay. Listen to me  I've been out of circulation so long  I've completely forgotten the social niceties. I mean  you ask me how I am  I'm not really supposed to say how I am. I'm supposed to say  ""I'm fine  thanks. How are you?"" I'm fine  thanks. - You must think I'm really strange. - No. Well  with due respect to the social niceties  even if you did think I was strange  you wouldn't tell me  would you? No  if I thought you were strange  I'd tell you. And you don't think so? Not a bit. Good. Glad we got that cleared up. So  what will you have? I would like a chicken potpie and a large glass of milk  please. Good choice. All the major food groups represented. Turkey sandwich  whole wheat  lettuce  dollop of mayonnaise  and I've got a joke for you. Two penguins were walking across an iceberg. One penguin turned to the second penguin and said: ""You look like you're wearing a tuxedo. "" Annie? I heard that. Wait a minute  I'll be right back. I wasn't quite finished. How long you been in love with her? Harry  who said anything about love? Coop  you just tried to tell her a joke. I did? So  what did the second penguin say? Well  the first penguin said to the second penguin: ""You look like you're wearing a tuxedo. "" And the second penguin said  ""Maybe I am. "" The defense rests. Do you want some more pie? A whole pie? Yes  I would  Miss Johnson  and a piece of paper and a pencil. I plan on writing an epic poem about this gorgeous pie. Okay. I see that you've been to Owl Cave. Sorry? Well  that design looks like the one up at Owl Cave. Let me see that. I combined Major Briggs' tattoo with the Log Lady's. This looks exactly like the one at Owl Cave. Harry  I've got to see this Owl Cave. Dear Donna  You were right  I had to go. Everything feels different when you're on the road. It feels better. San Francisco's really cool. Next stop  Mexico. I'll be back with a million stories. I promise. I love you  James. James? How is he? He's good. He's doing what he needed to do. He'll be back. Dad  can I ask you something? Sure. How does Mom know Benjamin Horne? I doubt that she does  Donna. Not very well. He was over here yesterday. They were talking like old friends. Your mother works a lot with the local charities. I'm sure even Ben contributes once in a while. She drove to The Great Northern this morning to see him again. Probably something to do with a fundraiser. I don't think so. Yeah  that's exactly what it was  she told me at breakfast. One of those heal-the-planet things. Well  she didn't mention it to me. Well  that's exactly what it was  that's what she told me. I'll get it. Hi  I have a delivery for Mrs. Hayward. They said they're for Mom. No card. I'll put them in water. Sorry  sorry  my fault. - I didn't hear you. - No. One should never allow one's mind and one's foot to wander at the same time. Edward Perkins. Once again  my apologies. Audrey Horne. Nice to meet you  Mr. Perkins. So  what brings you to the library? I'm doing research on civil disobedience. Good for you. It is incumbent on the young to disobey. Are you a professor? Well  I teach  poetry is my area of expertise. You're kidding. You know  someone sent me a poem  maybe you know it. Oh  perhaps I do. Now  let's have a look. You read it. Okay. See the mountains kiss high heaven  And the waves clasp one another  No sister-flower would be forgiven If it disdain'd its brother  And the sunlight clasps the earth  And the moonbeams kiss the sea What is all this sweet work worth  If thou kiss not me? Yeah  you know it. Yes. Shelley. What? Gazing at you reciting the verse of Shelley  you look very much like a queen. Thank you. I guess I better be going. Nice meeting you. - Perhaps we'll meet again someday. - Yeah. - Thinking of entering? - No. I think the real world's strange enough without getting on-stage and parading around in a bathing suit and heels. Guess the convent's not too big on that kind of stuff. That's a good guess. So  what's it like being back in civilization? It's not like they kept us up in an attic. I mean  we had newspapers  we even had cable TV. Every time I tell someone where I've been  they act like I'm out on parole. Sorry. You know what is weird? Being around men again. Well  you don't have to spend time in a convent to feel that. What do you know about Dale Cooper? Are we interested? Who said anything about that? Well  judging by the look on his face when he saw you today  I'd say you have a major opportunity. Sorry  you have it all wrong. I'm not even remotely interested. Andy? Yes  Lucy. I wanna thank you for helping out during the weasel riot yesterday. Which is more than I can say for a certain Dick we both know. Keeping the peace is part of my job. Where are you going with all of that gear? Spelunking. Is it dangerous? Spelunking? Sometimes. Promise me something? Okay. I know you'll be strong  and I know you'll be brave  but I want you to promise me that you'll be careful. I'll be careful. You have my word. Ohdear. - All set  Harry? - Pete just called in our next move. - We expose a pawn to his bishop. - Want me to hold off? No  Pete knows what he's doing. If he takes that pawn  he forfeits the bishop. Thus  losing his initial advantage. How you feeling? Like someone pounded a railroad spike through my ear. Then a descent into a cool  subterranean cave will be just what the doctor ordered. Are you sure Cole's up for the climb? Gordon's not coming with us. Shelly took him up to Doc Hayward's to see about his hearing problem. The old tuning-fork test. Audrey? When Jack Kennedy entered the White House  he took his brother with him. Because he trusted Bobby to tell him the truth  even when it wasn't pretty. When the Bay of Pigs went up in smoke  Bobby was there. When the Russians moved their missiles into Fidel's backyard  Bobby was there to help his brother shoulder through. Sort of how Jerry's done that for you? It's the unvarnished truth that I am looking for. And I believe that you are the best man for the job. Me? Audrey  I know that I haven't been a very good father. Oh  heck  who am I kidding? When have I ever been anything but a sleazy  rapacious heel? Well  Daddy  maybe when I was little  but-- Exactly. But I've changed. And I am determined to be a better person. The kind of father that you will respect someday. When I think about Laura  when I think about the mistakes that I've made  I want to build a life in happiness for our whole family. You  me. Will you help me do that? Please? Daddy  I'm your man. Sensational. Audrey  pack a bag  get out to the airport  your plane leaves in an hour. My plane? Oh  John. Just the man that I wanna see. Hi  Ben. Hello  Audrey. - Daddy-- - Audrey  you better get a move on. One hour. Audrey's on her way to Seattle tonight. She's having a breakfast confab with the environmentalists. We're going national with thispine-weasel thing. Great  that's great. Daddy  I'm not sure I can leave on such short notice. Now  here are the particulars. Time  place  so on. Audrey  you bring us back good news. Good news. Well  guess I better go. - Bye. - Bye. Travel safely  Audrey. John. How are you  Ben? I am filled to the brim with a feeling of goodness. Like a Christmas tree all lit up inside. But at the end of the day when I look in the mirror  I have to face the fact that I really don't know how to be good. You're off to a pretty fair start. How do you do it  John? What's the secret? Do you really think that I could learn to be good? I don't see why not. Just keep your eye on your heart. And always tell the truth. - Always tell the truth. - Tell the hardest truth first though. Oh  always tell the hardest truth first. Oh  I love that. John  that's terrific. This truth business  it's clearly at the forefront of goodness. Ben? - I'm falling in love with your daughter. - Yeah  that's a hard truth. - Good example. - It is the truth. - It is? - Yep. Oh  John. - John. - Ben. What a wonderful world we live in. - Come on  Andy. - Get a good grip  Andy. - Do it. - That's it  Andy. - Looking good. - Hand over hand. Almost there. Take it easy. - No  no  no. Don't look down. No. - Hang on  Andy. Don't look down. - Hang on. - Don't look down! - Andy. - You okay? I'm fine. Incredible. We used to play here when I was a kid. Pretend that it was haunted by fierce ghosts. Beer drinkers  by the look of it. Where's the symbol? This way. It's right here. There it is. Two symbols combined into a larger whole. But for what purpose? I don't know. Beats me. The tattoos are the question. This must be the answer. It's stuck. My pick  it's stuck. Oh  my God. Holy smoke. Look at that. What have I done? Fellas  coincidence and fate figure largely in our lives. It appears to be a petroglyph. Harry  I have no idea where this will lead us. But I have a definite feeling it will be a place both wonderful and strange. Good evening. Can I help you  young lady? Yes  I would like something to drink  but I'm not exactly sure what. Ladies seem to like the rum. Rum. I would like to have a rum  please. - With? - Tonic? Diane  Thursday  9:05 p. m. I've just returned from a place called Owl Cave. How I got there is a rather complicated story. It all began with a pair of tattoos First one's on me. Thank you. - Hello  Annie. - Hi. - Can I get you something--? - No  no. I have a rum and tonic. I see. One of the sisters used to put rum in her tea  and I thought it sounded exotic  so This is all new to you  isn't it? I feel constantly amazed  stunned. Music and people  the way they talk and laugh  and the way some of them are so clearly in love. It's like a foreign language to me. I know just enough of the words to realize how little I understand. Man  I would love to see the world through your eyes. Why? Oh  there's some things I might do different if I had the chance. Me too. You see  the thing is  I failed before and I'm just afraid it might happen again. You wanna talk about it? Not yet. Maybe I can help. Can you? If you want me to. I'm stubborn. Extremely willful. I can handle that. Some people think I'm strange. I know the feeling. I couldn't promise you that I would always make sense or do things that you would expect me to do. Annie  I don't expect anything. Then I accept your kind and generous offer. Good. I'm glad. My  my  my. What have we here? Could it be? Yes. The symbol inverted. Now"

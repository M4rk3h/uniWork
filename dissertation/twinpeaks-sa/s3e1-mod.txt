[Ray scoffs] Federal prison, South Dakota. [Darya] What the fuck? What did you do, Ray? [Ray] Carried weapons over the state line. I fucked up, the worst possible moment. [Darya] How are you calling me? [Ray] This is a burner. Don't worry about it. Nobody's listening. [Darya] So what do we do about Cooper? [Ray] I got another call from Jeffries. You have to hit Cooper if he's still around tomorrow night. That means you now, Darya. You have to do this. [Darya] Fuck. Fuck, I think his car just pulled up. Fuck! [exhales] Let's see what happens tomorrow. If I have to, I'll take him out. Shit, he's coming. I got to get off the phone. [line clicks] [clicks] [thudding] [atmospheric music] Shh. Are you going to kill me? Yes, Darya. Shit! [grunts] [whimpers] [blow lands] [whimpering] Darya who hired you and Ray to kill me? [sniffles] I don't know. [mumbles] I don't know. I swear, I don't Hmm? Ray knows. I don't know. He never told me. Do you really expect me to believe that Ray's in prison for carrying guns over a state line? Darya, look at me. This is quite an interesting thing to think about. The game begins. Did he say why they want me dead? No, I don't know why. How much do they want me dead? What are they paying you? We'd split a half a million. [crying softly] I wouldn't have done it. [crying] I just said that to Ray. Shut up, Darya. [crying] But you said you were going away somewhere tomorrow. Tomorrow, I'm supposed to get pulled back into what they call the Black Lodge. But I'm not going back there. I've got a plan for that one. But this prison thing with that fucker Ray [sniffles] Darya, did Ray get that information from Hastings' secretary? [crying] Did he ever mention coordinates to you? [whimpers] I don't know what that is. Geographical coordinates, numbers, letters. They could save your life. He said she told him something, but I don't know what. [atmospheric music] Anybody ever show this to you before? Do you know what this is? Huh? Did you ever see anything like this? This is what I want. [sniffles] Are you gonna kill me now? Yes, Darya.

Actually, I just called to say good-bye. This is Phillip Jeffries, right? You're going back in tomorrow, and I will be with Bob again. Who is this? [line clicks] [clicks] [device clicks] [rain pattering] [Chantal] Yeah? It's me. I need you to clean up in room six. Everything. Darya? That's good news. I was getting so jealous of that bitch.

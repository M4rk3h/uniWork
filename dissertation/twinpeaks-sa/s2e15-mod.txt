"15","Would you know his full name? I barely knew the kid. Jim. - Jim. - James. James Hurley. He said he was from Twin Peaks. He's a drifter. He was probably long gone by the time Mr. Marsh pulled out of the driveway. Did he work here long? Mrs. Marsh hired him to fix the Jaguar. Jaguar J-A-G-W-- A car. How did you meet him  Mrs. Marsh? Jeffrey's Jaguar broke down near Wallies. I went in to use the phone. He offered to help. Okay  we'll check that. Thank you. And so we bid adieu to James Hurley. Give it a rest. Careful  Evelyn. I'm not sure I can tolerate a nervous co-conspirator. I just want it over with  all right? Anything you say  Mrs. Marsh. James  we can't get out of this by ourselves. We're gonna need someone to help us. I didn't do anything. Malcolm killed Mr. Marsh. I'm being framed. Can I get you something  Miss Hayward? No. No  thank you. Look  it doesn't make any difference. We can't wait for the cops to catch us. - I think I should call Ed. - No  no  don't. I gotta-- My only chance is to talk to Evelyn myself. If she told me that this was all a setup  maybe she'll just tell the police that too. You're sure? Yeah. You wouldn't have a chance. The cops will be waiting for you. We've gotta keep moving. She'd listen to me though. I know she would. Would she? Why? I'm gonna go call Ed. Stay here. Hi  Ed? Hi  it's Donna. Listen  I don't have a lot of time  but I think James is in trouble. Well  he's been working for this woman. Working on her car  and I think there's been this accident and Hi  how are you doing  Yvette? Listen  I heard about your new boyfriend. Yeah  that's great  really. Good to hear it. So tell me about him. - Excuse me. - Hi  Frank. What were you doing at Shelly's house last night  Bobby? Shelly almost gets murdered and you're worried about what I'm doing? What about Leostein? What were you doing at Shelly's house? Look  here's the deal. Shelly and I are together  okay? We have been for a long time  since before Laura died  before and after Leo went into his drool mode. Bobby? Where were you the night the mill burned? What's that got to do with this? Leo tried to kill you. - Maybe you shot him. - No way. I went to Shelly's the night the mill burned down  because I was worried about her. He was about to bury an ax in my head when Hank Jennings shot him through the window. - You sure it was Hank? - Absolutely. What's Hank's connection with Leo? I don't know  man. Why don't you tell me? Shelly  do you have any idea where Leo might be now? No  I don't. I'll assign a couple of my deputies to the house 24 hours a day. Hey  man  I can take care of Shelly all right. You can just save the deputies. Bobby Briggs  button it. - You can go now. - Okay. Shelly  don't worry  we're not gonna let you out of our sight. - Thank you. - Come on  Shelly. I feel so much safer  don't you  Shelly? Bobby. Get a life  punk. Gentlemen. Another trip on the ""Seattle to Twin Peaks"" shuttle. How are you? - Looking good  Harry. - Yeah. - Albert. - Coop. - Gentlemen. - What have you got? My invite back to Twin Peaks. Windom Earle. Direct orders from Gordon Cole. As he so succinctly put it: ""I'm worried about Coop. "" Springfield  Kansas City  Lawton  Dallas  Jackson. Earle's been sending gift-wrapped packages to police departments and major law enforcement agencies. Each looks like a mail bomb  but they turn out to be harmless. The deliveries were paid for by a phony credit card signed Windom Earle. What's in the boxes? One article of clothing in each. One  a white veil  two  a garter  three  a pair of white slippers  four  a pearl necklace  and finally  a wedding dress. Caroline's. He's got DEA and FBI  not to mention Mississippi  Oklahoma and Illinois State patrols looking for him. Everyone's invited to the party. But my guess is  he won't dance with anyone but you  Coop. The vagrant from the office died from a knife wound severing the aorta. This guy's finger is pointed directly at this chess piece. How did Earle manage that with the rigor mortis? Well  rigor mortis goes from head to toe. But after two days  it leaves the body from toe to head. So he waited for it to leave the arms and the fingers so they could be maneuvered onto the chess board. And then he played Zeus at the power station. - What was found? - This map. Taped to the bottom of a table. Good work  Albert. He's making his move. Most definitely. Yeah. Oh  Coop  about the uniform. Yes  Albert? Replacing the quiet elegance of the dark suit and tie with the casual indifference of these muted earth tones is a form of fashion suicide  but call me crazy. On you  it works. Thank you  Albert. You're awake then. I trust you've slept well? While you've slept  I've learned all about you. Leo Johnson. The police would like to see you as soon as possible. Now  let me see. Drug trafficking. Arson. Attempted murder. Domestic violence. Now I am partial to that. Well  Leo  I've cleansed your wounds. You're on the mend. I've removed the proverbial thorn from your paw. Leo. Leo the lion. Now I want you to help me. And obey me. Will you do that? Did you know that  in the 13th century in Japan  the samurai were stripped of their weaponry. But they discovered that the aged and treated bamboo of their shakuhachi flute made an excellent cudgel. This flute is truly an instrument of pleasure. Don't you think? I wanted to save this necklace for an occasion  but you've ruined it. Now Come over here. I've made you some gruel. Come on  Leo  eat your gruel. Yum  yum. It's been 20 years  babe. One day we're talking about a graduation party and the next day we're here. And in between nothing but a world of hurt. I tried not to think about it. I just spent more and more time at the diner  trying to make the place work. Because I had nothing else. We were open every day  so I wouldn't have to have another life. No birthdays  no Fourth of July  no Christmas. Well  I turned all my Christmases into a week full of Mondays. When that didn't work  I thought about all the presents I never bought you. Never got to give you. I bought you a present last Christmas. It was a turquoise and onyx bolo tie. I walked over to your house to give it to you  but I couldn't go in. I just waited. I could see you through the window. I don't know why I couldn't go in. I'm sorry I didn't. All that time  you should have been in my home. In my bed. It's about the future now  Ed. And what we're gonna do about it. I want you to come tonight after I close the diner. Take me home. You're right. It's all ahead of us. Plenty of time. Eddie? - Eddie? - No  no  no. I may as well talk to her now. Hello  Nadine. I got all the way to the district finals at Knife River  only to find out the airplane slam is illegal. I was disqualified. Second place  what a drag. Oh  boy  what a tough break  huh? Hello  Nadine. I owe you an apology  Norma. I mean  I really pounded Hank and I am sorry. But I thought he was gonna do something to Eddie. And I sort of got mad. Thank you. Know what? I know about you guys. It's really  really okay. Because I don't have to feel so guilty about me and Mike. You and Mike? I don't wanna get into it  but I have to tell you  it is really  really serious. So you guys can go ahead and do whatever you want. I am completely cool about all of this. Really. Josie This is it. The Seattle police want answers and I have to tell them something. They know you were connected with Jonathan. How did he die? He was shot three times in the back of the head. Josie If you were ever gonna tell the truth  now would be an ideal time. Think I'll get another cup of joe. Is that you  Pete? - Yeah. Cooper? - Yeah. I get over to the Clean and Save and Jeanie Pombelek is working the counter. She does not speak one word of English. Nada  zip. She's from Budapest. We just stood there and looked at each other like we were made of wood. Who does all this belong to  Pete? Catherine's been running her into the ground. - Need a hand? - So I offered to stop by the dry cleaners and pick up Josie's stuff. You know  the only words I know in Hungarian are paprika and goulash. It took me 20 minutes to get this stuff. Let me get that. Give me a hand. Hello. Just hold a minute. - It's for Josie. Is she here? - She's in the other room  Pete. - Hello. - Josie. It's Thomas. I'm so glad I've found you. I was wondering if we could get together. Did you hear about what happened to Jonathan? Dreadful. Dreadful. Welcome to Twin Peaks  Mr. Eckhardt. She's run back to Catherine Martell. I'm so disappointed. So I asked Stonewall Jackson what he would like to do after we run the Yankees up to Canada. He said: ""Follow them. I wanna be the Duke of Montrï¿½al. "" Oh  that Stonewall. I once asked him what he thought I should do with Lincoln. And he says  ""Old Honest Abe is about as useful to you as a spittoon cleaner in a whorehouse. "" Traveler. What do you think  Dr. Jacoby? Letting him out to mingle with the public doesn't seem to have helped. Well  you have to admit  he's kind of fun this way. What's the matter with you? That's my father  your brother. We can't leave him like this. Well  now  Audrey  honey  now. There are some advantages to leaving himinsane. --Told me that every man  woman and child Now  Audrey  you know I was upset too  but there's some projects  both domestic and international  that I'd might get a chance to develop. I mean  one man's crisis is another man's opportunity. Let me tell you something  Uncle Jerry. We leave him the way he is  and I become executor of the estate. Audrey  it's a little more complicated than that  sweetheart. No  it isn't. I've examined his will  Jerry. If my father becomes incapacitated  it all goes to me when I'm old enough. And I am old enough  Jer  and he is incapacitated. I have my way either way. When the only project you'll be developing is selling baseboard heaters at the local Cash 'n' Carry. What's happened to the man is a tragedy. It is a tragedy  Jer. Dr. Jacoby  I want you to bring my father back. - To the office? - Parade  rest! To the real world. I think it's time we implement the Appomattox scenario. Hey  sorry I'm late. A couple of bikers tried to take this jacket. But old Stonewall's gone from me now  cut down in a hail of Yankee lead. He died alone  without my comfort. Laddy. Come here. You know what I wanna hear. Troops  about face. ""Dixie. "" ""Dixie""! Forward  march. Oh  I wish I was in the land of cotton Old times there were not forgotten Look away  look away  look away Dixie land Oh  I wish Mrs. Marsh? I'm Donna  James' friend. I remember you. Get the lady here a drink. With a little umbrella in it. Go on  dear  sit down  it's all right. - Why are you doing this to James? - Why not? Because he's a good person. He was good at two things: The car and me. You don't get it  do you? I'm talking about our lives. Life. Life will be rosy if you can just get out of one silly little jam. Maybe. Maybe not. Talk to me in a couple of years when your whole life has turned to crap. You really like to make everything sound pointless and stupid. If there was a reason to climb out of this primeval swill  believe me  dear  I'd know it. Would you  really? Oh  here we are. The car's waiting  Mrs. Marsh. Get in it. I'm sorry about your friend  honey. There's nothing you can do. So why don't you trundle along to your little town  safe in the knowledge that  if I ever see you here again  I'll kill you. Don't do this to him  please. Please. Coop  take a look at this. Vicuna thread sample taken from Josie's coat. Traces found on the floor outside your room. They're from the same coat? Let me put it to you this way  either Josie Packard pulled the trigger  or she's loaning her winter wear to the wrong people. - It's a perfect match. - What about the gloves? Checking for powder burns. I'll have the results in the morning. From the Seattle Homicide? Locals are looking for a beautiful Asian woman  late 20s  in connection with the murder of one Jonathan Kumagai. He has an Interpol sheet as long as your arm and three holes in the back of his head. I'm betting the bullets will match the slugs we took from your vest. I hope it's not Josie  for Harry's sake. Coop  as you know  Truman and I have had our differences in the past. But the big lug's got his heart in the right place  if nothing else. And I'm not above feeling a little sympathy for the stalwart and the dull. - What's you point  Albert? - Speaking frankly? Feel free. Our sheriff's got a serious problem with his girlfriend. Albert  not one word until we're certain. Coop. Our John Doe's got a name: Erik Powell. Transient. Former merchant marine by his prints. Powell? Yeah  ring a bell? Powell was Caroline's maiden name. Do you think this Powell is a relative? No. Earle's playing the game according to his own rules. Every move he makes sends a message. The fact that he chose the name Powell tells me he hasn't forgotten a thing that went on between us. So whenever he takes a piece from the board Someone dies. I never beat him  Harry. Coop  if you've got a need for a chess expert  we've got one of the best right here in town. Checkmate. Checkmate. And mate. Frankly  I am impressed. I owe it all to the great Josï¿½ Raï¿½l Capablanca. Now  if there's chess boards in heaven  Josï¿½'s sitting next to the Lord. - Doc? - The mind reels. One of these days. Pete  I need your help. I'm playing a chess match of considerable importance. I can't say any more than that. Suffice to say  I'd like to stalemate the game  losing as few pieces as possible. None  if that can be arranged. Well  Agent Cooper  I'd be proud to serve. Thanks  Pete. Great players are either far or few. - Hi. - Shelly. I'm sorry about what happened. Are you okay? Not really. I wanted to come right over  but with Hank gone  it's been a madhouse here. You don't need any help  do you? I I'd I'd feel safer  Norma. Are you kidding? It hasn't been the same without you. When can you start? - Now? - Great. Welcome back. Thank you. Norma? - Hi  Shelly. - Hi. Excuse me. I need to talk to you for a minute. There's something you should know. Hank's nearly ready to leave the hospital. What about his parole violations? Harry  this time I don't want him back. Don't worry. He won't be back. Hank's going to jail. We're charging him with the attempted murder of Leo Johnson. Add that to breaking parole  Hank's going away for a long time. Good. Mr. Eckhardt  welcome. Josie  help our guest with his coat. I must confess I received your invitation with some surprise. Well  word travels fast in Twin Peaks. I thought it was fitting that I dined with my late brother's business rival. Some wine  Josie. Your brother was not always my rival. We were friends. - But your friendship soured. - Sadly. Men of business frequently find their personal lives disrupted by the larger portraits they paint. You consider yourself an artist? The wine  Josie. Of a sort. Your brother was as well. I wonder  Mr. Eckhardt. When you had him killed  was it for art or money? - Don't stand there  Josie  pour. - Call me Thomas. Your brother did. Thomas. We'll have our hors d'oeuvres now  Josie. One does not kill for art or money. They are commodities easily lost and just as easily gained. However  one  rather I  might find reason to kill for love. - Did you love her that much? - Yes. Josie has the most incredible hands. Every finger a thing of beauty. I remember. I wonder  what shall we do about her? It would be a shame if you left empty-handed. Of course  I'll miss her cheery disposition. We've become the best of friends. Two girls chatting over tea. Perhaps you should purchase an animal of some kind. A cat or a dog. If I give her to you  what will you give me in return? How can I place a value on something so precious? But you will try? Yes. Josie. Thomas and I will have our main course now. Why did you do it? You know I've been going through it. - I can't figure it out. - James  you're not safe here. - If Malcolm finds you-- - Is it the money? Is that it? No. No  I got it. It was Malcolm. Oh  yeah. He made you do it. Right? You better tell me a story  Evelyn. Because I'm all mixed up. I just wanna know why you would do this to me. James. What did you expect? An apology? A hidden heart of gold? I did it all  James. I did everything. I found you  I lured you in and I kept you here  while Malcolm planned a nice  neat little frame. - Why? - For the money. Out of fear. Because I wanted to do it. It's not exactly what you wanted to hear  is it  James? The truth hurts  doesn't it? James  you're good and you're honest. I'm not. But that doesn't mean there weren't moments when I truly wanted you here. Not for Malcolm  or for the money  but for me. For the good and honest way that you taste. I like how you taste too. Malcolm  what did you do? James  James. You hurt him. He broke into the house  he was angry  he was crazy. He killed Jeffrey and he came back to kill you. You poor  defenseless little widow. But you were ready for him  Evelyn. You got your gun  and you shot James. You shot him until he was dead. - General Lee. - Whoa. Welcome to our humble horse-- Home  General Lee. - Thank you. And you are? - Scarlett McLean. And this is my father-- This is my father. Wilmer McLean at your service. I'm indeed honored to be making your extremely sociable acquaintance. And why are you armed with my sword  sir? I like your sword  sire. - Thank you  Daddy. Thank you. - Where is General Grant? General Grant's a-coming  sire  I know it. Excuse us. General Grant. General Lee. Sir  we met during the Mexican War. Do you remember? I have come to surrender the North. The Mexican War  sir. Do you remember? Oh  yes  yes. It was a good war  as I remember. Nonsense. All wars are nothing but madness. Disguised as the patriotic ventures of politicians  too old and too cowardly to participate in them. - No  no  sir  I have no love for war. - Me neither. - And even less for politicians. - Hey  amen. But  as for the men who fight them  they have my eternal respect and sympathy. All right  general  enough of this fruitless conversation. My terms: Federal officers may keep their sidearms and other general possessions. Officers and men claiming to own their own horses may keep them too. And officers and men will be allowed to return to their home  not to be disturbed by the Confederate States' authorities. - I surrender. - Of course you do. The articles. - Here  sire  the articles. - Sir. The articles  sir. - You will sign  General Grant. -Oh  yes  yes  yes. And may I add that  that you've been a valiant opponent of fine character. I thought the North won the Civil War? Ben? Ben. Daddy. - Ben? Ben? - Daddy? Hey  give him some room. Where am I? - Where am I? - Twin Peaks  Ben. I had the strangest dream. And you were there. And you  and you. It was incredible. It was a war. And I was General General Robert E. Lee. And somehow  in spite of incredible odds  I won. Now you're home  Daddy. Yes. - I'm home. - Attaboy  Ben. How do you feel? Any  any aftereffects? Dizziness? I feel terrific. - I feel - Yes? - What is it  Daddy? - What are you doing in those clothes? Attaboy  Ben. What? What's the joke? Attaboy  Ben. Work slowly. And with care. Everything must be written with a steady  uncompromising hand. No  no  no. Terrible. Erase. Erase. Now Try again. Concentrate. Leo  for heaven's sake. Here. Let me show you. Like this: There you go. Much better. I am proud of you  Leo. - Windom Earle? - Yes. Windom. Pretty words for pretty girls. Which one shall be my queen? Queen? No. No. No. Lick. The story rings a little truer with your fingerprints on-- No  Malcolm  I can't. Just your prints. Leave the rest to me. I'll do my best to imitate the actions of a hysteric. Five shots  tightly grouped  as though the gun went off in your hand. - Repeatedly. - No! No! No! James  James  James. - Don't hurt him any more  please. - Give me the gun. I've called the cops. They're on their way  it won't work. - Malcolm. - She's lying. Give me the gun. Evelyn  please don't let him die  please. - Please. - Evelyn. Give me the gun  Evelyn. - Evelyn  give me the gun. - No. - Evelyn  give me the gun. - No. Evelyn. Evelyn. I can't do this  Malcolm. Then I will. No. He was angry  he was crazy. He killed Jeffrey  came back to kill me. I was ready  though. I got my gun and I shot him. I shot him till he was dead. Caroline. For Miss Audrey Horne  please. Owls? Breathtaking  wasn't she? A truly beautiful woman  Caroline. Funny  isn't it? After all this time  after all that happened in Pittsburgh  I still love her. And I know that you do too. Now  Dale  listen carefully. It's your move."

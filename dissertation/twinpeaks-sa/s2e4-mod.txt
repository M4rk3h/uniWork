"4","Daddy. Daddy. Leland. Daddy. Leland. Daddy. Daddy. Leland. Leland. Leland. Leland. Leland. Yeah. You have the right to an attorney. I waive that right. I'm gonna ask you some questions. Anything you say may be held against you in a court of law. Do you understand? Yes  of course  I do. On Friday morning  March 3rd  did you go to Calhoun Memorial Hospital? Yes. Why did you go there? I was looking for someone. Who were you looking for? The man who killed my daughter. Did you know his name? No. Yes. I do now. Jacques Renault. What made you think he killed Laura? You arrested him. Leland did you kill Jacques Renault? He killed my Laura. Have you ever experienced absolute loss? I doubt that any one of us is a stranger to grief. No  more than grief. It's deep down. Inside. Every cell screams. You can hear nothing else. Yes. I ki-- I killed him. Yes. Yes  yes  yes. Yes. - He'll plead temporary insanity. - We'll need a psychiatric exam. I'll tell you one thing  parents should not bury their children. Anyone who's been through what Leland has is-- Do you approve of murder  Dr. Hayward? No. Hey  doc. - How are you  Andy? - Fine. Great. Fine. What's the problem? It's kind of personal. I'm your doctor  Andy. It's about my sperms test. Yes? You know  I flunked. That's not the precise term for it. Well  I was just wondering if it's the kind of test you can take over. You know  like a driver's exam. I mean  I've been wearing boxer shorts every day just like you told me. You wanna give it another shot? Yes  sir. I would. I'll need to take a sample with me. - Right now? - Put it in a brown bag. I'll wait in the car. Lucy  I've got a garbage truck here on Oh  shut up. Our judge arrives this afternoon. Clinton Sternwood. Travels the circuit in a Winnebago. Outdoors enthusiast? Last of the frontiersmen. They broke the mould. I only got bail hearing for Leland and Leo's competency examination. Will Leland get bail? Well  Harry  that's up to your state prosecutor. That'd be Daryl Lodwick. Also on his way. When do we hear from Hawk? He called this morning. Now  the county says nobody by the name of Robertson had ever lived next to the Palmers. We got a current address on the last occupants. Kalispell. We'll check it by afternoon. - Hey. Watch it  Andy. - Sorry  Bob. Oh  my God. Andy  don't move. - Where did you get those? - Don't make me say where these came from. Andy? Please  Agent Cooper  this is extremely personal business. Your boots? Oh  I'm sorry. I bought these from Philip Gerard yesterday when he was waiting. Sorry. These are the same brand of boots we found at Leo Johnson's. The Giant said there was a clue out there. I thought it was the cocaine? Harry  we've gotta find Philip Gerard  the one-armed man. Can I go now  Agent Cooper? I don't know how much time I've got. If you must. Harry  what's with Lucy? - Mr. Horne. - Walk and talk. This friend of mine works with the Seattle Post-Dispatch. Actually  my sister went to college with her but she's a friend of mine too. Anyway  she called me this morning with a hot tip. Top secret. M. T. Wentz is coming to Twin Peaks. M. T. Wentz. M. T. Wentz. M. T. Wentz  the travel writer. Yes  M. T. Wentz the travel writer. Wentz travels incognito  uses only cash  no credit cards. Nobody can trace his identity. Or hers. No one at the paper even knows who he or she is. Favourable Wentz review could be quite useful. Well  he's coming. He's coming  he's coming. Keep your eye on registration. I want a hourly update. - Scrutinise every cheque. - Especially if they pay cash. Not even 9:30 and you have already done a good day's work. Mr. Horne. You look well. - What can I do for you? - Oh  we've met. I sell insurance to the small business. Like One-Eyed Jack. Jean Renault. What's the occasion? Are my premiums about to be raised? No  no. Nothing like that. Please. Please. You bastard. - You bastard! - Make no mistake  Mr. Horne. I'm just the messenger. From whom? They request a large sum of money. How much? I require something else entirely. They should bear the cost of their own middleman. Number one. Your business up there is being run by pickpockets and fools. A dollar earned is a dollar stolen. Are you aware of that? I have my suspicions. What you need is a partner. Someone who can take care of these little problems. - I have a partner. - Okay. Do you want my help or no? Yes. One more thing. I want this man to bring to me the ransom. This man is an FBI agent. Do you want your daughter back? Of course  I want my daughter back but I can't-- Cash partner FBI man. This is supposed to be an equitable exchange. This could turn out well. Expect a call tomorrow noon. Janet. Find Agent Cooper for me. It's urgent. You're kidding? What's he look like? Well  you're looking real pretty today  Donna. - Thanks. - Special occasion? Yeah. I'm having lunch today with someone I met on my route. Bedpans and shut-ins. Who's to meet? You wouldn't understand. - Don't spill the soup. - Thanks  Louie. Hey  listen to this. I just got a call from Louie at the Northern. M. T. Wentz is coming to Twin Peaks. Empty who? Hank  he's the most powerful restaurant critic in the state. - Really? - Yeah. And a good review from him and his Seattle paper could give us a lot of business. So she's gonna try to send him our way. What's he look like? Well  nobody knows. I guess it's a secret. But he's supposed to be arriving today. Then we still got time. Time for what  Hank? Time for what  Hank? I'm gonna pick up some flowers and maybe some candles and some tablecloths. And what can we add to the menu? Some specials maybe. I always wanted to try some regional dishes. Babe  we're gonna trick this place out like Christmas on the Fourth of July. Oh  and I think you should give Big Ed a call. - Why? - Well you're still friendly  right? So maybe this Wentz guy stops in for gas. Ed could suggest the Double R to any new faces he sees. - I'll call him. - Good. You do that. So what shall we drink to? To Laura. To Laura. In our hearts and memories  locked. Her diary. Did I tell you I had it? Laura's diary? Shall I read something from it? It seems appropriate. Please. ""But still I'm afraid to tell her of my fantasies and my nightmares. Sometimes she's good at understanding. Other times she just giggles and I don't have the nerve to ask why things like that are funny to her. So I feel badly again and shut up about it for a long time. I love Donna very mu-- But sometimes I worry that she wouldn't be around me at all if she knew what my insides were like. Black and dark and soaked with dreams of big  big men and different ways that they might hold me and take me into their control. "" I'm sorry. No  don't be. L-- I was just  I mean-- I mean  if that's evidence  shouldn't we give that to the sheriff? No. I mean I've-- I've read this from cover to cover  Donna  and there are no solutions here. Besides she gave it to me. Why? People come to me and tell me their stories about the world outside. I take their stories and place them in a larger context. A sort of living novel. Who tells you? Oh  friends. Lovers. Well  maybe  someday  you will too. You were right. Her kidnappers contacted me this morning. Damn me  but you were right. Why didn't you alert the sheriff? He'll kill her at first sign of police involvement. That's why I called you. That's no reason to circumvent normal channels. Normal channels won't bring my daughter back to me alive. You and Audrey You have a special relationship. You  of all people  understand her value to me. They wanna make the exchange tomorrow. Audrey for $125 000. Cash. But I must ask you. Will you take it there? Josie. Oh  Pete. So sorry. Yeah  me too. You know  I keep thinking about Andrew. What he would have done about the fire. Thank goodness Catherine was here to handle everything. What is it? Josie  Catherine died in the fire. God  no. Oh  Pete. Oh  Pete. We're We're planning a service but they haven't found the body. Oh  Pete. In a couple of days we'll go ahead. I don't know exactly what we'll be burying. Right this way. Come on  dreamboat. Daddy's waiting. Come on. Miss Horne was a very bad girl  refusing to take her medicine. - Please. - Weren't you  Miss Horne? Audrey? Audrey  have you been mistreated? He hit me. I did not hit her. If that's what you're thinking  I didn't. That was wrong. It will never happen again as long as you're with me. Do you understand? I spoke with your father this morning. You're in no danger. Everything going to be fine. You do trust me. Don't you  Audrey? You see  Audrey  in a situation like this  you have to handle yourself in a professional manner. We're all reasonable people and what you discover is that something reasonable can always be worked out whenever reasonable people just put their minds-- No. Lucy? Lucy  we need to talk. Deputy Brennan  I thought you preferred the company of your magazine? Andy? Maybe you'd better get some air. Lucy  I think we're at the point where it would be healthier for everyone if you got whatever was bothering you out in the open. Andy and I used to go out. That much I gathered. For a year and a half until I started to notice things about him. They weren't big things  they were little things. He never exercises. He never washes his car and he doesn't even own a sports coat. Well  did you do something about this? Well  after I watched this TV show  I decided I needed some me time during which we didn't see each other. During which period I met Dick Tremayne. Horne's Department Store  Men's Fashions. He had lots of coats and keeps himself and his car in great shape. Most of his behaviour was asinine  but at least he was different. Are you still seeing this Dick? No. Lucy  do you wanna get back together with Andy? I don't know. Well  Lucy  can you tell me exactly what you do want? I don't know. Sorry  Harry  I was trying to help. Well  it was a good thought. But it's like trying to fix those potholes over on Highway 9. First heavy rain and You've been down this road before? Sure have. Harry. I've got a dangerous situation. I've examined every possible angle and I believe there's only one way to proceed. I need a favour  strictly between us. What's up? I need one of the Bookhouse Boys. Your best man. It would be better if you didn't know why. Cooper  I've steered clear when you asked me to. Is there anything I need to know about this one? Absolutely not. I'll set it up. Nine-thirty at the Roadhouse. Thanks  Harry. - It must be him. - Here we go. Good evening  sir  welcome to the Double R Diner. Thanks  could I have a booth? Of course  right this way. We have two very delicious specials this evening-- I'm sure you do but I'll have a cheeseburger  medium  a Coke and some fries. Very good. Excuse me  Toad? Why don't we finish this up in the kitchen. Get in the back and don't touch anything. He only wanted a cheeseburger. It must be some kind of food-critic trick. - You think so? - Absolutely  yeah. I think-- Bathroom? Oh  right this way  sir. We just finished painting it and it looks really nice. It's completely private. Yeah  follow me. Oh  sorry. - Good stuff. - Toad! Toad  get out of my Thanks for coming. - I didn't know - Know what? I didn't know if you were mad or not. I mean  how mad. I'll survive. Donna  there's nothing going on between me and James. What if there is? I mean  who said James and I couldn't see other people? I certainly didn't. Are you saying you're seeing someone else? Maddy  I need your help. - How? - Harold Smith has Laura's diary. I thought the sheriff had Laura's diary. Harold said that Laura kept a second diary that I didn't know about and he's got it. God. We have to tell James about this. If Laura did have a secret diary and Harold's got it I'm gonna get it with or without you. Tell that to James. I know I paid too much for it  but I just fell in love with it. I heard the salesperson say  ""The only reason we're still in business is because Josie Packard buys retail. "" I like it. - You do? - I like it  yeah. - You're so cold. - Josie. Josie  I gotta know. Were you really in Seattle? Yes  why are you so suspicious? Look at these boxes. You think I got them at Cash and Carry? Why didn't you tell me you were going? You know I had to get away  I was afraid. - I know  afraid of Ben and Catherine. - You know that. And now Catherine's dead. Harry? - You don't think l-- - I don't know what to think. - I don't know. - You think I could burn the mill? That I would ruin everything of mine? There's insurance money. My God. How could you? How could you think of such terrible things? How could you hurt me so? I was just so worried. I'm sorry. Hold me. Hold me. - Take me. - Josie. - I want you to take me. - Josie. Josie  why? Why didn't you tell me? Tear it. What? Tear it. I want you. I need you. I want you more than my own life. Hi  good-Iooking. Who do you have to grease to get some coffee around here? Judge Sternwood. Hello  Your Honour. Lucy  you're a cool drink of water to road-weary eyes. What's your secret? I'd rather not talk about it  sir. Give us a hug? Life is hard  dear. Still and all  it's It's harder in most places than in Twin Peaks. Clinton. Sorry I'm late. Oh  I only just arrived. Good to see you. What's her name  Harry? - What? - You got the look of a man with filly trouble  son. If they don't take the saddle  you got two options. - And I won't bore you with either one. - Harry? Judge Sternwood  Special Agent Dale Cooper. FBI. - How are you lad? - Your Honour. You two should have a lot in common. Sid will bring in the court calendar as soon as the Winnebago is tanked up. You wanna break the seal on that Irish you stashed for me? Right this way. Mr. Cooper  how do you find our little corner of this world? Heaven  sir. Well  this week  heaven includes arson  multiple homicides and an attempt on the life of a federal agent. Heaven is a large and interesting place  sir. Lucy? Dick. Lucy  I haven't slept. I can't eat. I've been absolutely miserable. You have? I've been a fool  a cad  the way I've behaved and I'm I'm deeply  deeply ashamed. You are? I've been over it in my mind a million times and what I've come to is this. I have to-- No  I must do the right thing. You must? It's-- It's everything I could scrape together. I'm completely knackered. What is this? Six hundred and fifty dollars. I've called around. I've been told it's more than adequate. For what? For the-- To take care of-- You know the little problem. Richard  here's what you're going to do: Take your money  put it back in your wallet or your pocket  turn around and walk through both sets of doors-- The second one sticks sometimes. --Go out into the parking lot  get in your car  turn the key  and never  ever speak to me again as long as you live! Say one more word and I'll scream. Leave  please. Dick! Dick. Leland this is most difficult. My deepest condolences on your heartbreaking loss. Thank you  sir. You've appeared before me many times. I know you to be a fine  decent man and a capable attorney. And to see you under these circumstances is Is dreadful for us all. Now  the law provides a structure to guide us through perilous and trying times. But it requires our submission to its procedures and higher purposes. Before we assume our respective roles in this enduring drama just let me say that when these frail shadows we inhabit now have quit the stage  we'll meet and raise a glass again together in Valhalla. Would that it were so. I understand it's your intention to represent yourself. Correct. Well  where's Lodwick  the prosecutor? - Overdue. - Well  I suggest we leave the question of bail until morning. The facilities are adequate  Leland? Oh  yes. Everyone has been most kind. Then we'll say good night. - Deputy. - Good night. Thank you. I'll speak for us all. We have hard jobs. We're ready to roll. Well  hi  Sid. Harry.

Very good  Mr. Tojamura. The bellman will take you up to your suite.

"16","Now  Dale  listen carefully. It's your move. Please put your heart into it  will you? I've noticed a certain tentative quality in your thinking  as if your mind were occupied with issues other than those on the board before you. Such preoccupation not only weakens one's resolve  but one's foresight as well. A deadly failing in any match  you must agree  but in this particular contest  quite disastrous  as we play for grave stakes  the likes of which you have no doubt surmised. Print your move in tomorrow's paper. Or I will make it for you. That tears it. Cooper  I'm not letting you out of my sight. Harry  if Windom wanted to kill me  I'd already be dead. Yeah. - Better get Pete on the horn. - Right. Lucy  call Pete Martell  get him over here right away. Then call the paper. Find out the latest possible deadline for tomorrow's personals column. Paper and Pete  got it. I'll do it alphabetically. She was beautiful. She was the love of my life  Harry. Okay  Lucy. Okay  yeah  just tell Harry I'll be right there  okay? Right. Peter. Salt and pepper. Coming right up  poodle. You two bring out the worst in each other. - Oh  Pete's a prince of a man. - A court jester. Well  I've got to mosey. Goodbye  you sweet Packards. Oh  Catherine. Catherine  I'd always have hoped that time and age would mellow that tempest raging inside you. Watching you two act like the Hardy Boys always brings on stormy weather. What's happening with Ghostwood? I talked to the investors  the meeting is set. I leave for Paris tomorrow. Oh  company. Dear Josie I'm home  did you miss me? Oh  she looked surprised. - Poor Josie. - Oh  she has her charms  though. Yes  but not for long. Come in. - Hi  Harry. - Save it  Hank. What happened? Did you get up on the wrong side of the bed this morning? So I broke parole. Cry me a river. You crossed the border into Canada. You consorted with the drug dealers at Dead Dog Farm. You tried to kill somebody. I'm charging you with the attempted murder of Leo Johnson. Well  I think it's safe to assume that I was at the diner the night that Leo was plugged. - But you're welcome to call-- - I got a witness. Puts you at the scene with a gun in your hand. Harry  you obviously seem serious about this  so I'm going to propose a trade. How about information leading to the arrest and conviction of Andrew Packard's murderer? Hank Jennings  witness for the prosecution. No deals. You're telling me you're more interested in the attempted murder of Leo Johnson  felon  than Andrew Packard? How's that gonna sit with your constituents? You're through  Hank. My guess is  Harry  not too well. Especially once they find out who pushed the button on Andrew and that you're sleeping with her. Gee  I'm sorry. Get him out of here. Get him out of here! Give me that. This is the bullet we removed from you. This is the one that was excavated from the dead man's skull. Same bullets  same gun  same killer. Let's go get her. - Albert  hold your horses. - Coop  I appreciate any reluctance you have for busting your pal's old lady  but the woman ventilated you and left you for dead. Albert  I don't take it personally. What about the gloves  the powder tests? News at 5. All right  fine  you're not mad  but there's an epidemic of multiple gunshot wounds following this chick around. She is a menace. I'll talk to her. Maybe she'll confess  turn herself in. Maybe she'll grow wings and join the circus. Randy  I've got a list of all our non-repeat guests. We're gonna send them a special invitation to the Great Northern. Your enthusiasm brings a salty tear to the eye. However  I think you will find my job requires a little more than a tight sweater and a perky attitude. Randy  I'm learning the business. Every week a different department. I don't want your job. Yes  I look forward to your stint in housekeeping. This came for you this morning. Good luck  Miss Horne. You'll need it. Hi. - I just checked into Room 215. - Congratulations. Strange  they told me at the front desk I should talk to you. What is it I can do for you? Sorry  thought you were working. I am working. I'm working  see? I see. Audrey. - Horne? - At your service. Could you send someone out to the airport? I'm traveling with some heavy equipment this trip. Didn't have enough room in the van. - What flight were you on? - My own. On the jet out there. Shouldn't be hard to find. Is there anything else I can do for you  Mr. Rockefeller? No  thank you. Yeah. I have a picture of you. You're wearing a little dirndl skirt  got a white apron on  you have pigtails. It's unbelievably cute. I don't wear dirndl. You did then. It was right here. The Great Northern dining room. If I close my eyes  I can almost see it. Little Audrey Horne as Heidi. Well  anyway  it's unforgettable. Heidi. I was 10. Hey! Thank you. ""Save the one you love. Please attend gathering of angels tonight at the Road House  9:30. "" Nadine? Honey  what are you doing home from school? Are you feeling poorly? Don't. Don't what? Oh  Eddie. We have to talk. Okay. Mike and I are in love. - In love? - I hope you're not hurt. I wouldn't wanna hurt you for anything in the world. Honest  you have to believe that. But Mike and I  on that wrestling trip  we had the most magical night together. All night? Well  you and Norma did it. Well  that's fair. So  what's this mean? Eddie. We have to call a spade a spade. We're breaking up. Eddie  I'm so sorry. Josie  I want you to level with me about what happened in Seattle. I told you. How many times do I have to say it? I escaped from Jonathan in the airport and I don't know what happened to him after that. Do you understand I could arrest you right now? I came here as a friend of Harry's. Now  I don't know what place he occupies in your heart  but I do know that you own his. I would think you'd like a chance to explain yourself to him. Please go. This is the end of it  Josie. There are no other options. I want you at the station house by 9:00. Or I come and find you. Oh  Josie  I just saw Agent Cooper leave. Was this a social call? Dear  you look awful. Is everything all right? - I don't feel very well. - Oh  I'm sorry. I wish I had better news. I've spoken to Mr. Eckhardt again on your behalf. While he's not entirely unsympathetic  he does insist on seeing you alone. Tonight. He'll kill me. To tell you the truth  my biggest worry is what he's going to do when he finds out that Andrew is alive. Won't Mr. Eckhardt think that you've betrayed him? But of course  you can tell him that you didn't. After all  you did actually think that Andrew was dead. Oh  no. I don't know. I don't know. Maybe you can help me. I think I'm going mad. You will simply have to face Mr. Eckhardt sooner or later. Tell him the truth. Tell him whatever you want. Just pray that he believes you. Oh  there they are. No answer. He must be on his way. Thanks  Bobby. Look  why don't you join us? - Yeah? - Yeah. You know  board meetings are usually nothing more than a gathering of self-minded individuals  each more intent than the other on financial gain. No  thank you. But today Today is going to be something completely different. Am I late? Hot dog  Ben  look at you. How are you? - You are a sight for sore eyes. - Look who's talking. - We taking good care of you? - The best. My luggage arrived. Thank you  Audrey. - You two have met? - Briefly. John Justice Wheeler. Used to be in construction. - Came up the hard way. - How nice. You remember my brother Jerry? - That is Jerry. Oh  my God. - Hi  Jack. And this is my executive assistant  Bob Briggs. - Bob. - Hey  what's up? - Pleasure. - Why don't you all just take a seat? I've asked Mr. Wheeler to join us on the board. Years ago  I made an investment in him  a pittance  which he built into an empire. Now  I don't take any credit  but I believed in Jack even when he was a local boy pounding nails. I've asked him to return the favor and believe in me now. Ben  you're testing my well-worn modesty. All right  suffice to say  Horne Industries Incorporated have fallen on hard times. The mill  the Ghostwood lands  are now solely owned by Catherine Martell. We don't begrudge her  the mill was and is  after all  hers. So  in spite of these reversals and stripped of all the trappings of success  what are we left with? The human spirit. What is the greatest gift that one human being can give to another? The future. I give you the little pine weasel. Found only in our tri-county area  it is nearly extinct. They're incredible roasted. According to an environmental impact report  what few pine weasels remain will be all but wiped out with the Packard plans for Ghostwood development. So you wanna save the weasel? No  Bobby. Not just the weasel. But life as we know it. I want Twin Peaks to remain unspoiled in an era of vast environmental carnage. So we block Catherine's development until the wheel turns and we get another shot. That's brilliant  Ben. That's brilliant. I plan to fight this Ghostwood development on every ground and with every available weapon. The little pine weasel is about to become a household word. Then what? Then I am considering a run for the Senate. Thank you. Annie  it's no problem. I've got plenty of room. You just get on the next bus  okay? And I'll be waiting. Oh  honey  don't cry. It's gonna be all right. I'll see you soon. I love you too. Bye. - So your sister coming? - Tomorrow. God  what do you have to do to get out of a convent? You just leave  it's not a prison. Sounds like prison to me. No TV  no boyfriends. You know  when she was little  I always used to think that Annie was from another place and time. I guess the convent has been good for her in a way. Hard to imagine her out in the world. Oh  look  here's something for you. - Who from? - I guess who was ever sitting there. Look at this. ""Mountains kiss  waves clasp. Flower  sunlight  the moonbeams  is all this  thou kiss. "" None of this makes sense. ""Save the one you love. Please attend a gathering of the angels tonight at the Road House  9:30. "" Sounds intriguing in a way  but it sounds dangerous. I wonder who this is from. Norma Jennings  I've loved you every day for the past 20 years and I dream about you every night. It's time for us to be together. Will you marry me? - Ed? - We deserve to be happy. It's our turn  baby. All night long I held her in my arms Just to keep her From the foggy  foggy dew Good job  fella. Good boy. Just a few more  and then we'll eat. Fly to my breast  Pierce me in colors autumnal  speak to me only of love. Leo  you have an incomplete education. For instance  survival in the wilderness? A relevant issue in your life  my friend. Now  this comes under the heading of practical instruction. I hope you've been paying attention. Nature is cruel. This is also a lesson. Hi  honey. How are you feeling? Oh  great  now that you're here. Hank  I came here to ask you for a divorce. Well  first let me say  I don't blame you. You gave me a second chance and I blew it. I don't know why I'm so self-destructive  but I can see that that's my priority in getting well. I got a lot of work to do. In fact  I decided I'm gonna try to go into therapy. I don't wanna be like this anymore. That's very interesting  Hank. But I have to get on with my life. I know. I know you do. I just want you to be happy. Thank you. I want you to do me one last favor. I want you to help me get out of here. If they send me back to prison  I'll die. Tell the sheriff that I was at the restaurant the night that Leo Johnson was shot. I was on my way home. I can't prove it  but you can. No more lies  Hank. It's not lying  it's trying to save my life. No. You're killing me here  Norma. Don't blame this on me. Don't you dare. Is it Ed? Is that who you're running to? Okay. Then here's the deal. You give me my alibi and I give you your divorce. I didn't come here to negotiate with you. This is it  it's over. Fine. Go ahead. You're his whore  Norma. I'd rather be his whore than your wife. Norma! Norma! Now  there are four or five different ways of doing this thing  and they all have their virtues. I remember Capablanca and Lasker  St. Petersburg  1914-- - Pete. - Yeah. We've only got five minutes. All right. - Lucy. - Sheriff? Get the Gazette on the phone. Tell them not to close out the personals. We need more time. - The Gazette. - Okay. That's it. Guaranteed to cause some sleepless nights. As long as he can't remove another piece from the board. He can't do it. Not at least for five  six more moves. Maybe he'll kill anyway. - Maybe it'll just frustrate him. - I don't think so  Harry. Earle has a perverse sense of honor about these things. I never heard of a man who murdered by the rules. Coop? Albert. Good work  Pete. Here it is  straight up. I got a match on the gun that whacked you with the powder residue on Josie Packard's gloves. Seattle police have also come up with an eyewitness who positively ID'd Josie leaving the car where they found the stiff. If you ain't gonna bust this bitch  - I would consider it a personal-- - Albert  I can handle it. I think you just did. Come in. I assume you still have a taste for bubbly. We've killed enough bottles in our time. To beginnings. And endings  and the wisdom to know the difference. I am sorry  Andrew. I hated you at first  of course. Perfectly normal response. As my anger diminished  I recalled that Eckhardt has a way of persuading people to do anything. - It was his idea  of course. - Yes. He made me do it. And he said you never loved me. You just married me to get back at him. That's not true  I did love you very much. Of course  the same cannot be said for you. Please  Josie  let there be no more lies between us. You had a job to do and you did it. Now you're paying the price. Every action has its consequence  my dear. The police are closing in. If you don't take action  you'll be sleeping in a jail cell tonight. What can I do? Please help me. You must see Eckhardt. Perhaps you were meant to be together all along. I'm sure he truly loves you. He doesn't know I'm alive. He can get you out of this country. Go to him  Josie. Now. Andrew. We won't speak again. Hi. Hi. It's beautiful. I wanted us to go someplace we've never been before. Come on. How did it go with the police? They asked a million questions that I didn't know the answers to. But the ones I did must have been enough. Evelyn's gonna stand trial and I'll be a witness. You're not wearing the ring. I know about you and Evelyn. I wouldn't blame you if you hated me. James  I know what you were feeling. I was feeling it too. Evelyn just took advantage of it. Well  it was wrong and I should've known that. Look  it's okay for you to feel bad about what happened to you  but I don't want you to feel bad for me. If we could just start over again Please come home with me. I can't. Not right now. You're right. You should go. But what about you? Can't worry about me anymore. I've been a part of all the horrible things that have happened. I wanna be a part of something good now. James  go. Take all the time you need. I love you. I'm gonna miss you like crazy. But you'll go away and you'll come back with great stories. And none of them are gonna be about Laura or Maddy or Evelyn. And I'll be here. - Come with me. - No. Well  then  I'll come back  I promise. Coming. Coming. - Pete  I need to see Josie. - Come on in. - I think she's gone out. - Yes  it's rather odd. She took my car without saying a word. Well  she told me the Great Northern. Oh  did she? Well  she took a lot of things with her. I don't know where she was going. But I'd say she was planning to stay a while. What else did she say  Pete? Well  that she was going to see an old friend. Who? Sheriff  I suppose it's been very hard on all of us learning the truth about Josie. Catherine. Who? Eckhardt. Thomas Eckhardt. Poor man. Lobby  please. Thomas. We meet again. I don't believe in ghosts. Pity  it's an appealing notion. The return of the grisly phantom from the grave. You deserve haunting  to be sure. Look closer  Thomas. I'm alive. How? Guess. It's really very simple. Josie. She warned me off herself. Couldn't bear to see her beloved husband perish. Or more realistically  I suppose  she felt there was some advantage to be gained. She betrayed me. We're all familiar with betrayal. Josie is mine. She belongs to me. Oh  Thomas  love will break your heart. Happily  long ago  I lost interest. But Josie loses her heart with alarming regularity. The local sheriff  of all people. - I have taken care of that. - I don't doubt it. Sometimes I wonder if our Josie does these twisted things deliberately. Don't you? As someone who was once your friend  I come back with a warning. Josie is coming back to you  be very careful. I'm always careful. Well  here we are  the lobby. I'll be going back down to the garage. My resurrection remains a well-kept secret. Thomas. Bye. I know that I have a lot to learn. Jack  you shall be my teacher. Think of me as an open book  upon whose virgin pages you shall scribe. You okay? So  Mr. Wheeler  what is it exactly you do do? First off  call me Jack  please. I buy bankrupt  failing businesses. I streamline them  bring them back up to speed and then usually sell them. At a substantial profit. But not  I should add  before making significant environmental concessions. No  when Jack is finished  the waste is rerouted  the air The air is cleaner. And the people happier. Ben  you make me sound like Santa Claus. I'm a businessman  that's all. You'll have to excuse me  the chef just tried to stab Jerry. You kids carry on. Pay attention. So  Mr. Wheeler  which is it  are we bankrupt or just failing? I came to do an old friend a favor. And it's Jack. My father's friends are rarer than the pine weasel. Well  let's just say that Ben was once a very good friend to me. So you came back to bring us all up to speed. You are Santa Claus  Mr. Wheeler. I'd better hang up my stocking. You don't like me very much  do you  Audrey? I don't have an opinion either way. But if you did? If I did  I'd say that the Hornes have managed to take care of themselves just fine for more years than you can count. And desperate though we may seem  will probably continue to do so in the foreseeable future. Indeed. Where have you been all this time? I mean  when you weren't busy rescuing widows and orphans and making our world a better place to live in. The far corners of the earth. I tell you  it's glorious out there  Audrey. All in all  it's good to be home. I'm only 18. And what exactly does that have to do with the price of eggs? Nothing. God  look at the time. I have an appointment. - Could you tell my father? - Sure. Okay. See you. Bye. I'll see you later  Jack. I'll see you  Audrey. - Shelly? Hi. - Hi. How are you? I'm okay. How are you doing? You know life. Drag? Are you waiting for James? No. Actually I got this really weird note. Somebody wants me to meet them here. That strange? That is strange  look what I have. It looks like we all have something to talk about. It fits. See the mountains kiss high heaven  And the waves clasp one another No sister-flower would be forgiven If it disdain'd its brother And the sunlight clasps the earth  And the moonbeams kiss the sea-- What is all this sweet work worth  If thou kiss not me? - This is weird. - I'll say. Cooper here. Yes  Catherine. No  no  I was just on my way over. She's here? Thomas Eckhardt's suite. I see. Help! - Please help. - I love you. - No! - Josie  please. For God's sake-- Don't touch me. Don't touch me! Don't hurt me. Stay where you are. He tried to kill me. Is that what you'll say about me  Josie? That I tried to kill you? What about Jonathan? Did he try to kill you too? He was taking me back. Why did you shoot me  Josie? Because you came here. I knew this day was going to come. I'm not going to jail. I can't. Put it down  Josie. - Harry. - Put it down! Harry  forgive me. I never meant to hurt you. Josie. Josie. Josie. She's dead. Josie. Coop  what happened to dead Josie? Oh  Josie. Oh  Josie."

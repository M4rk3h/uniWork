The thing is, though, it's hard to see the color at night. Red. No. That's black. Like I was saying, it-it's real tough to see the color at night, so There it is. There's your door right there, Mr. Jones. [footsteps circling vehicle] [gasps] Mr. Jones? Mr. Jones? Mr. Jones. All right. All right. I'll wait right here with you. [owl hoots] Damn. Those things spook me. [door opens] Dougie? [Janey-E] Is that you? Dougie! Where have you been? - What is this? - Ma'am h-he was a guest at the Silver Mustang, on his own, and I was asked to bring him home. I'll be going now. Three days without a word? You don't show up at work, and you miss Sonny Jim's birthday. - How could you? - [car door closes] [engine turning over] Get inside. [dog barking distantly] [door slams] What have you been doing? Huh? Why didn't you call me? Where'd you get that black suit and that haircut, Dougie? What's in this bag? Huh? Dougie? Dougie. Dougie, there's there's thousands and thousands of dollars here. Where did you get this? [exhales shakily] Did you get this at the Silver Mustang? [Janey-E] Huh? Dougie! Don't tell me you hit the jackpot. Mr. Jackpots. You won it? Dougie? Well, there's there's enough here to pay them back. The You could We could Oh oh [sighs] This is the most wonderful horrible day of my life. Of my life. Yes. I'm gonna fix you a sandwich, and then I'm gonna get you a piece of Sonny Jim's chocolate cake, 'cause we saved a piece for you. Okay? Oh, Dougie. I'm so glad you're home, Dougie. Home. The chief of staff will be with you in a moment. [shouting] Where is she? In a meeting. She's just finishing up. Okay, Bill. - How's Martha? - Oh, she's fine. Thank you, Gordon. She ever fix that thing with Paul? Ah, yes, yes, yes, yes. Good of you to remember. Paul is now in the North Pole. Well, there you go. Please, have a seat. Thank you, Bill. [door opens, closes] [telephone ringing distantly] [footsteps approaching] Denise. Gordon. Thank you for coming in. What have you got? It's Cooper. We found him. Where? South Dakota, Denise. He's in a federal prison in South Dakota. We're going out to see him tomorrow. I heard. Yes? How's that? You're taking Agent Preston with you? Yes. Really, Gordon? What are you getting at, Denise? Well, I know your profile, Gordon. Beautiful agent, barely 30. I'm old-school, Denise. You know that. Before you were Denise, when you were Dennis and I was your boss, when I had you working undercover at the DEA, you were a confused and wild thing sometimes. I had enough dirt on you to fill the Grand Canyon, and I never used a spoonful because you were and are a great agent. And when you became Denise, I told all of your colleagues, those clown comics, to fix their hearts or die. Yes, and as I've said many times before, Gordon, I can never repay you enough for that kindness. Agent Tammy Preston has the stuff, Denise. I know. I know. I'm speaking more as a woman now than as the chief of staff of the entire Federal Bureau of Investigation. Don't you just love sometimes saying Federal Bureau of Investigation like that all at once? Unabbreviated? Oh. It just gives me such a thrill. It is thrilling, Denise. And Tammy Tammy is so beautiful. There's room in this Federal Bureau of Investigation for more than one beautiful woman. Oh, Gordon. That is so sweet. You know, normally, I can't think like this. I have to forgo all that and grow balls of steel to do this job, and it's it's a bitch, let me tell you, sometimes Not to mention the screaming hormones. Oh. I know. I'm sorry, Gordon. I know. Gordon, I trust you. You know that. And I believe you're on the trail of something big. Big. Will Albert be with you? Do birds fly? Good luck. Ten-four, good buddy. Thank you, Bill. Please come along. [door closes] [insects chirping] Well, it has to do with the thermostat. It doesn't actually tell you what's going on when no one's here. Uh, mostly, we don't have prisoners, but even if we did, they couldn't even see the thermostat. So I had a man out here recently to look at the furnace, and, Sheriff Truman, he wouldn't answer any of my questions about what happens when no one's here. We come in early, and the heat is still on. What if we came in even earlier? Would the heat still be on then? Are you next to a loud stream, Sheriff Truman? You're breaking up. Are you still fishing? Are you next to a really loud stream? You're breaking up, Sheriff. Well, I-I hope we can get this sorted out when you get back to the office, but right now, it's very comfortable in here. I have to go, Sheriff Truman, because there are some people coming in through the front door. [gasps] [screaming] Lucy. Lucy. You were on the phone with her again, weren't you? Andy, I'm sorry. We lost connection. I couldn't stand out in the parking lot all night. I hate cellular phones. How is this possible? Lucy, hang up the phone. But you're in the mountains fishing! Oh, punky. Punky. Eleven seventy-one. Fifteen oh-seven. Ten-four. [Maggie] Six ten. Ten oh-seven. Copy that. Oh, hi, Sheriff. Evening, Maggie. What's going on tonight? Kind of quiet. A domestic, two D&Ds, and a DUI. I booked that one. Dude blew a . 250. Could not even find his nose, let alone touch it. Oh, and it was terrible. A boy OD'd at the high school Dennis Craig. Andy took the case. He spoke with the parents. Little Denny Craig. When the bell rang, he never got up from his desk. Where's Hawk? He's in the conference room. Gents. Bobby. Another apparent OD Little Denny Craig, although I haven't seen the autopsy report. I'm guessing it was - Chinese designer drugs again. - Mm-hmm. Anything on your surveillance cameras? Uh, elk, deer, raccoon, squirrel, and a bear. If they're coming down from Canada in our area, I would've seen them. - I got every trail covered. - Every known trail. Right. Frank, I got to take a leak so bad, my back teeth are floatin'. Meet you in the conference room. Good deal, sir. [groans] Cell phones that means they're mobile, punky. The sheriff can be moving. It's not like your phone. He can be moving and even driving while he's talking. Lucy you're so good at your job in every other way. I just don't understand how this keeps happening over and over again. I don't understand it either, Andy. You collect yourself. I've got to go see Sheriff Truman. [Hawk] I know she seems like a strange one, but her information has always been spot-on. So Margaret says that something is missing having to do with Special Agent Dale Cooper and only you can find because of something about your heritage. That's what she said. I'm here, Sheriff Truman. Good, Andy. [sighs] I'm feeling a bit better now, Sheriff Truman. I thought that log woman was 10-96 and not even allowed in this building. That's on account of a kind of gum. Well, I'll chew on that. That's enough, Chad. She gets messages from her log. Pinocchio's friend. Good night, Chad. [scoffs] I'll go have a word with my pinecone. [ Laura Palmer's Theme playing] Laura Palmer? [crying] Man brings back some memories. Sorry. What's all this about? Message from Margaret Lanterman to Hawk concerning Agent Cooper. Cooper? Special Agent Dale Cooper. Yeah, I know. Cooper was the last person to see my father alive. What's that? Yeah. A few days after my dad died, my mom told me that Cooper had come by the house and talked to my dad, and I guess Cooper left town pretty soon after that. I don't Nobody's seen or heard of him since. And my dad died in the fire at his station the next day. And do you know what they talked about? Uh, no. No. I have no idea. [brooding music] There's a man out front. He says his name is Wally Brando. [both] Wally? Wally's here? [gasps] Oh! Their son. He said he wants to pay his respects to you, Sheriff Truman. Oh, boy. [file thuds] [door closes] [Lucy] Oh! Ooh! Oh. [laughing] Sheriff Truman, look who's here! It's Wally. We're so excited. He came in unannounced. Good to see you again, Wally. It's good to see you, too, Sheriff Truman. As you know, your brother, Harry S. Truman, is my godfather. I heard he is ill. I came to pay my respects to my godfather and extend my best wishes for his recovery, which I hope will be swift and painless. It's an honor to see you again. You know my heart is always here with you and these fine people, my parents, who I love so dearly. And I was in the area, and I wanted to pay my respects. Thank you, Wally. [inhales deeply] I also came back to let my parents know, because this has been a matter of grave concern for them, that I've decided to let them do what they wish with my childhood bedroom. They want to They want to build a study for the two of them. Such sweet people. Oh. That's such beautiful news, Wally. Tell us where you've been, Wally. My family, my friend I've crisscrossed this great land of ours countless times. I hold the map of it here, in my heart next to the joyful memories of the carefree days I spent as a young boy here in your beautiful town of Twin Peaks. From Alexandria, Virginia, to Stockton, California, I think about Lewis and his friend Clark, the first Caucasians to see this part of the world. Their footsteps have been the highways and byways of my days on the road. My shadow is always with me. Sometimes ahead. Sometimes behind. Sometimes to the left. Sometimes to the right. Except on cloudy days or at night. [inhales deeply] Yes. Well, Wally it's great to see you again. And may the road rise up to meet your wheels. That's a lovely turn of phrase. Thank you. My dharma is the road. Your dharma [bird cawing] [bird cawing distantly] [footsteps oddly reverberating] [atmospheric music] [oddly reverberating] [footsteps approaching rapidly] Dougie! You're not even dressed! Is something wrong? What's go Oh, for God's sake. What is with you? Listen, Mr. Dream Weaver, you go potty, and then let's get you dressed fast. You're worse than Sonny Jim. [urine splashing aggressively] [groaning] Oh! Oh. Oh [sighs] [bird cawing distantly] [ominous music] Dougie, you've lost weight! [scoffs] Let me cinch this up. And this jacket looks two sizes too big. That black suit last night fit you perfectly. We'll just have to take that to the cleaners and maybe get you another one. Okay. You do your tie. I can never get that right. Now, I have to go downstairs and finish up breakfast. Hurry up. Sonny Jim! Get going! [bird cawing distantly] [chuckling] [Janey-E] Sonny Jim, get down here! [Dave Brubeck's Take Five playing] [chuckling] [chuckles] [silverware clatters, drawer closes] [chuckling] [chuckles] Here's your coffee. Coffee. - [chokes, gags] - [sizzling] - Dougie! - [Dougie] Ah! Hi! [Constance] You got to see this. We got a hit on the prints we took off the male John Doe. - What's the name? - Don't know. It's blocked. Some kind of security issue. Well, can you tell who blocked it? Military. Oh. [computer whirring] [airplane engine roaring overhead] Thank you for meeting us. Let's get going. [airplane engine roaring overhead] We're not anywhere near Mount Rushmore. I brought a picture for you. There they are, Albert faces of stone. Agent Preston gets carsick. Albert we're in South Dakota. Cossacks are in Russia. - Carsick! - [brake pedal thuds] [tires screeching] Do you need me to pull over? Up on the wrong side of bed this morning, Albert? [gate buzzing] [lock buzzes] What have we got? We found him after his car went off the road. He'd been, uh, throwing up some kind of poison. Must have eaten locally. They're, uh, analyzing it in the lab. Exposure to it sent the highway patrolman to the hospital. Huh. As I mentioned, the vomit's still in the lab. This is what we found in his trunk Cocaine, machine gun, dog leg. What, no cheese and crackers? Apologies in advance for Albert. That's your man, right? Holy jumpin' George. Let's go talk to him. [footsteps departing] Ladies and gentlemen, I am going to speak now to Special Agent Dale Cooper. [Murphy] We'll be down the hall if you need us. Thank you, Warden Murphy. [footsteps departing] [door opens, door closes] [button clicks, shutter whirring] It's very good to see you again, old friend. It's very, very good to see you again, old friend. I haven't seen you in a long, long time. No, you haven't. This is true. Gordon, I've really, really missed spending time together. Yes, Coop. I, too, have missed our good times together. Where have you been all these years? Gordon, I've been working undercover all these years, working primarily with our colleague Phillip Jeffries. Phillip Jeffries? [Cooper] I need to be debriefed by you about this work, Gordon. I will tell you the whole story, all its twists and turns, and I was going to do so. I was on my way to present it to you. I was a little bit behind schedule when my car veered over across the road, and I had my accident. Yes, Coop. This is how and why we found you. [Cooper] I need to be debriefed by you, Gordon. I was on my way to present it. I was a little bit behind schedule when my car veered over off the road, and I had my accident. [eerie music] I've left messages. What messages were those, Coop? Messages so Phillip knows it's safe. Gordon? When are you going to get me out of here? Coop, these fine fellows here have sufficient cause to hold you for now. Of course, I will be exonerated in courts of law. Very good, Coop. And rest assured that we are working to bring you back home for our talk. I've never really left home, Gordon. See you soon, old friend. [chain rattles] [button clicks, shutter whirring] [door clanks] We can hold him for two more days without filing any charges. I assume you haven't given him his phone call. No, we haven't. Warden Murphy, I suggest you give him his private phone call, and I expect to hear all about it. He wasn't going to Philadelphia. He was headed west. A few people who have come in contact with him have gotten physically ill. Are you feeling all right, Albert? I'm fine, Tammy. And who is Phillip Jeffries? He's a former FBI agent. [button clicks, static whines] You're wearing a wire, Tammy. You asked me to. Right. Go wait in the restaurant. [scoffs] I'm feeling better now. Albert, your reaction in prison to Cooper, I've not seen this before. Is there something you'd like to tell me? Well, since you asked, and I can't tell you how sorry I am about this I authorized Phillip to give Cooper some information. Cooper and Phillip? What the hell? Phillip Jeffries has been off the radar for years. This was years ago, Gordon. He called me. He did, did he? I know. I thought Cooper was in trouble At least that's what Phillip said. Urgent, he said. Cooper needed this information urgently. Did you talk to Cooper? No. What information did they want? I told Phillip who our man was in Columbia. And? A week later, that man was killed. Albert. Albert. Albert. [high-pitched squealing] This business that we witnessed today with Cooper, I don't like it. No. Something's wrong. Yes. It could be the accident, but I don't think so. No. [shoe scrapes against pavement] Albert, that sound you just made of your feet on the concrete, it's like a knife in my brain. I'm sorry, Gordon. Albert, this thing is turned up to the max. Please. [quietly] I'm sorry, Gordon. I don't think he greeted me properly, if you take my meaning. No, he didn't. Something is very wrong. Yes. Albert, I hate to admit this, but I don't understand this situation at all. No. Do you understand this situation, Albert? [sighs] Blue Rose. It doesn't get any bluer. Albert, before we do anything else, we need one certain person to take a look at Cooper. I'm right with you. Do you still know where she lives? I know where she drinks. [woman] So [Au Revoir Simone playing Lark ] So long So long ago There wasn't anyone out there I thought I needed to know But no more When I find the day leave my mind In the evening Just as the day before I saw the window was open The cool air I don't know what you saw there Don't know what you saw in me Sometimes I want to be Enough for you Don't ask Know that it's understood There's not enough of me I saw that something was broken I've crossed the line I'll point you to a better time A safer place to be [electricity crackling]"

"3","- Get her arms. - I got this side. Miss PuIaski? - Cover her arms. - Miss PuIaski  caIm down now. It's okay. It's gonna be aII right. - Get her Iegs. - I got it. Hang on. Miss PuIaski  just caIm down  pIease. - You're aII right. - Give her a sedative. No! No! Ronette puIIed out her IV. I just gave her a sedative. Looks Iike dye. - Harry  give me a hand. - What's this? A IittIe chIoride. Spray her finger. AIbert  get your microscope. AII right. AII right  Ronette. Breathe  now  honey. - He's been here. - We have a 24-hour guard. Harry  he did this. And he tainted the IV. Maybe she saw him. Maybe she heard a Sousa march and got up to Iook for her baton. I'II do a workup on the IV. That's our man. Those Ietters were never made pubIic. FeIIas  Iet's stand together for a moment. It's time I mentioned something. Now  I'm not sure  but I beIieve I was visited by a giant. Twice. In my room. He Ieft me three cIues. The first had to do with Jacques RenauIt in a body bag. It came true aImost immediateIy. The second was  ''The owIs are not what they seem. '' The third was about a man who points without chemicaIs. You were visited by a giant? Any reIation to the dwarf? You're wearing a different sweater than yesterday. CoIour's better on you. I forgot my manners. I'm HaroId Smith. I guess you know who I am. PIease come in. WouId you Iike some Iemonade? I aIso have some saItines and some appIe butter. Or wouId you Iike to wash your hands? No  thanks. I insist. It's very warm in here. - Don't be nervous  Donna. - I'm not nervous. I'm curious. Curious about my reIationship with Laura. Why did you send me that Ietter? Laura wanted me to get in touch with you if anything ever happened to her. Why? She said you'd ask a Iot of questions. How Iong did you know Laura? Ever since she began MeaIs on WheeIs. I was her best customer. You don't seem much Iike a shut-in. You mean  poIiteIy  what's the matter with me? Okay. I don't Iike to go outside. I can't. Do you have a judgement you'd Iike to express? No. Laura said you were very fair-minded. If you knew her so weII  why didn't she ever mention you to me? WeII  Laura Iiked to think of me as a mystery in her Iife. Then why did you caII me? I am-- WeII  I used to be a horticuIturist. I raise orchids. That's why it's so warm in here. They don't need a Iot of Iight. I wrote to you because I wondered if you'd be kind enough to pIace one of them on her grave. Of course. - WiII you excuse me a moment? - Sure. This is a hybrid. - A Iady's sIipper. - It's very beautifuI. Take it  pIease. My Iast gift to Laura. That's very kind of you  Mr. Smith. HaroId. She was very kind to me. Forgive me  but I know so much about you  you see. What? You're every bit as IoveIy as Laura said you were. I'II be back. I'II be here. R  B  T. Harry  I beIieve that these Ietters and the Giant's cIues are in some way reIated to this Iong-haired man. Mrs. PaImer saw him in a vision. She caIIed this morning to say that Maddy had seen the man twice in the past two days  both times in a vision. I've seen him in my dream. And Ronette. - Saw him physicaIIy at the train car. - Right. Four of us have seen him in different forms. This path is a psychic Iink that wiII Iead us straight to him. So  what did this giant sound Iike? I mean  did he have a big  booming voice or what? - No  no. He spoke softIy  distinctIy. - And you gave him the beans you were supposed to use to buy a cow? No  AIbert  I gave him my ring. Okay  confining my concIusions to the pIanet Earth  the cocaine you found in James HurIey's gas tank was a match to what we found in Jacques' car and Leo's house. Get the picture? You even got the frame. Handiwork of Leo Johnson  currentIy appearing at CaIhoun MemoriaI HospitaI as Mr. Potato Head. The boots are a CircIe Brand rare work boot. Ones we found haven't been worn or tampered with. The Ietter B from Ronette's finger was cut from a copy of FIesh WorId. It's a perfect match. This particuIar edition features swingers' cIubs for standard poodIe enthusiasts. No comment. We sent a portrait of your Iong-haired man to every agency from NASA to DEA and came up empty. This cat is in nobody's database. A man that four of us have seen here in Twin Peaks. Sure. Oh  by the way  you were shot with a WaIther PPK. It's James Bond's gun  did you know that? You're Iooking better today  Coop. Thank you  AIbert. FeeIing better. The traiI of the man who shot you is ice-coId  but I hoovered some fibres from the corridor outside your room. My ticket out of TroIIeyviIIe. I'II be at the Iab  gentIemen. - Anything we shouId be working on? - Yeah. You might practice waIking without dragging your knuckIes on the fIoor. AIbert  Iet's taIk about knuckIes. Now  the Iast time  I knocked you down. I feIt bad about it. The next time's gonna be a reaI pIeasure. You Iisten to me. WhiIe I wiII admit to a certain cynicism  the fact is that I'm a naysayer and hatchet man in the fight against vioIence. I pride myseIf in taking a punch and I'II gIadIy take another because I choose to Iive my Iife in the company of Ghandi and King. My concerns are gIobaI. I reject absoIuteIy revenge  aggression and retaIiation. The foundation of such a method is Iove. I Iove you  Sheriff Truman. AIbert's path is a strange and difficuIt one. Deputy. James  you're not gonna be charged. The cocaine we found in your bike was pIanted. - I was trying to teII you that when-- - James  I don't want to see you down here again. Yes  sir. Stop trying to figure it aII out yourseIf. Find someone to taIk to. TaIk to me. Go on home  James. How's it going  Lucy? Seventy-five words. Oh  wait a minute  76. - Seventy-seven. - Good work  Lucy. That's 78. Agent Cooper asked me to find as many words as I couId that contain the Ietters B  T and R. Let me see. I used to be pretty good at this. My Iunch date is here. This is the date that made Andy caII in sick? Hi  Luce. There you are. HeIIo  Dick. Lucy  I've aIways considered you to be a woman of Ietters. ''Prohibited. '' I say  I don't beIieve we've met. Richard Tremayne. Horne's Department Store. Designer Menswear. Robot. Did I do something to anger him? Not that native peopIe don't have enough reason to be angry  per se. - Let's go to Iunch. - CapitaI. We'II go Dutch. So how taII was this guy? Did his head hit the ceiIing? AImost. I beIieve that the ceiIings in The Great Northern are at Ieast 1 0 feet taII. At Ieast. I'm sorry. I hope I'm not interrupting. That's okay  LeIand. What's on your mind? This man. I know him. How do you know him  LeIand? When I was a IittIe boy  my grandfather had a summer home up on PearI Lakes. We used to go there every year. - You knew him from there? - Yes. Yes. Now  I know that he wasn't a CheIbert. They were our neighbours that Iived on one side. On the other side there was a vacant Iot. Next to that was a white house. That's where he Iived. Do you remember a name? No. I think I think it was Robertson. Robertson. Robertson. Robert. R  T  B. That's what the Ietters are trying to speII. Hawk  get up to PearI Lakes  find out who used to Iive in that white house. I'II do what I can. LeIand  thank you. - That's vaIuabIe information. Thanks. - Thank you  LeIand. Something eIse. He used to fIick matches at me. He'd say: ''You wanna pIay with fire  IittIe boy?'' That's our man. Of course  most of the time I keep my department running Iike a top  but Christmas-- WeII  that was such a madhouse. Was absoIuteIy no time for paperwork. I simpIy had to deveIop a system to memorise customer orders using mnemonic triggers. For instance  someone Iooking for argyIe socks? WeII  that wouId fiIe under A for ''argyIe '' subheading S for ''socks. '' Now  it does get tricky. A request for a vuIcanised mackintosh  for instance-- Now  does that fiIe under R for ''raingear '' or W for ''waterproof''? My famiIiarity with the inventory finds me Ieaning towards an R. Lucy  may I ask you something? Do you find it odd that I don't switch my fork when I eat  that I Iift it to my mouth with my Ieft hand? My mother caIIs it piIing. ActuaIIy  it's not odd at aII. It's the European way. It's been six weeks  Dick. You said you were gonna caII. I know. I Iost your phone number. I work for the sheriff. You couId've diaIIed 91 1 . Lucy  I do apoIogise. I've been so terribIy busy  honestIy. I've hardIy had time to feed my cat. We went out every Thursday night for three months. You made promises to me. You said you were going to take me to dinner at the Space NeedIe in SeattIe. Even though you took me to FamiIy Night at Pancake PIantation  I stiII couIdn't heIp but think that it meant something speciaI. When in fact the onIy thing speciaI we did that night was drink two bottIes of champagne and end up on a dispIay bed in Horne's Home Furnishings! I admit it was daring. That made it exciting. StiII  I thought it wouId Iead to more. Like a phone caII. Lucy  I feeI terribIe you're upset. ReaIIy I do. - Let me make it up to you. - Like how  for instance? For starters  I know I promised you a new dress at my 20 percent empIoyee discount. After Iunch  I'II go right back and arrange something with Ms. BoIbo in women's wear. Very speciaI indeed. Oh  yeah? How about a maternity dress! Pardon? I'm pregnant  Richard. Pregnant. Preggers? Does Donna seem different to you? What do you mean? WeII  Iike  doesn't her smoking and stuff bother you? She's trying to act  Iike  aII tough aII of a sudden. James  you know her better than I do. Yeah. She came to visit when I was in jaiI and I don't know. What? WeII  she acted Iike she wanted to do it with me through the bars. She didn't even care if anybody was around. I don't know. It was weird. It wasn't Iike her. I don't know. I don't know anything anymore. Sometimes I think I shouId just get on my bike and go. James. Running away won't soIve anything. It's gonna be okay. Donna  where you been? You're Iate. I met someone from MeaIs on WheeIs. Those oId foIks must have some pretty cooI stories. This was a young man. ReaIIy? What's wrong with him? You know  it's hard to say. Other than he was bright and charming  inteIIigent. CompIeteIy unIike anybody I know. What's that supposed to mean? Why don't you sit here and hoId hands and try to figure it out. That's good  Emory. She's ready for her cIose-up now. We shouId get rid of her. She knows I sent Laura up here  she knows her father owns the pIace. With what Ben Horne wiII pay to get his funked-up IittIe daughter back  I'II buy the bastard out. Look  I don't wanna Iose my job. Honey  if this doesn't work  you'II Iose a Iot more than your job. We can't handIe this aIone. Ben Horne is dangerous. Now  Iisten  you spineIess gasbag  you are in this up to your shiny pate. Now  stop whining. You do as I teII you  and we'II have aII the heIp we need. Look at her. Riding the white tiger. In a few days she won't wanna come down. Just Iike her daddy did to me. Now  these babies are just perfect. For heavy fieId work  and they're extremeIy versatiIe. - DurabIe  with a steeI reinforced toe. - Not quite right. Now  if the department does any parading  on the Fourth or Veterans Day  these are your best bet. - Nice  huh? - Yeah. Add some siIver-trimmed Iaces  it's a reaI eye-catcher. I can see that. But a IittIe outside my budget  Mr. Gerard. I understand compIeteIy. - You need something more practicaI. - Yep. A shoe for aII seasons. Now  this is more Iike it. Yeah. Jim-dandy. Very popuIar. The IoveIy thing about-- Mr. Gerard? Mr. Gerard  you okay? I'm sorry. Sometimes I get a bit disoriented. Can I get you something? Water? If there's a bathroom  I have a medication. Sure. It's right down the haII. This way. Thanks for coming down  SheIIy. Sheriff  I'm just gonna say this: I know I don't have to  so I'm not gonna say anything against Leo. We're not asking you to. He's my husband. I don't have to testify against my husband. WeII  you're not testifying. You're just giving us a statement. Doc Hayward says he's too sick. What difference does it make? The difference  SheIIy  is there's some peopIe injured and there's some peopIe dead. Now  we know Leo started that fire. And we know you were there. I'm not gonna say anything against him. I Iove him. Okay  SheIIy  that's fine. - Thanks for coming in. - What? Oh  I think SheIIy's thought Iong and hard about this. Maybe someday  with a IittIe Iuck and some topfIight medicaI attention  you'II have Leo back. The same oId Leo that you obviousIy stiII Iove. Maybe then he'II reaIise what a wonderfuI person he's married to. What? Thanks again  SheIIy. Best of Iuck. What's going on? SmeIIs Iike insurance money. SheIIy didn't dream this up herseIf. So who do you think is puIIing the strings? Harry  that's a damn good question. Bob I know you're near. I'm after you now. - Mr. Horne? - Tsk  tsk. Gotta go  Jerry. Mr. Horne  have you heard anything from your daughter? Not since I spoke to Sheriff Truman yesterday. She phoned me Iast night. - From where? - She didn't say. She referenced seeing me in my tuxedo. Now  I was wearing a tux here at the hoteI the night that I was shot. WeII  Iike I toId you  Audrey's gone missing before on a semi-reguIar basis. So have two other IocaI girIs recentIy. Mr. Horne  speaking frankIy  is there troubIe at home? Mr. Cooper  do I detect a note of something outside the scope of professionaI concern? Audrey and I have struck up an acquaintance. Acquaintance. Agent Cooper. Let me give you the best advice that you're gonna get aII week: Men faII under the speII of Audrey's charms Iike ducks in a shooting gaIIery. And if you don't want a Ioad of buckshot in your taiI feathers  may I suggest that you park your jaIopy outside of somebody eIse's window. Mr. Horne  if I've overstepped my bounds with my concern  I apoIogise. I am here with onIy the best intentions. That is achingIy cIear. And not unappreciated. I'II put a Iamp in the window  and you'II be my first caII when she comes home to roost. Thank you. No  thank you. WeIcome back. Where am I? I brought you something. Open wide. EngIish carameIs. Sugar's what you need. - PIease - Go sIow  baby. Candy's dandy  huh? PIenty more where that came from. My name is Jean. Sweet sIeep. FeeI the warmth. That's the man. Oh  my God. - You know him? - FBI. He's FBI. I saw him at the town meeting after Laura died. He was up here? I want him. Jean RenauIt. Emory  Say something weak and fawning. Jacques was your brother? And this is my sister. Nancy? I aIso had a brother  Bernard. This business cost me them both. I toId you we'd have heIp. I'm your go-between. The father pays me  my cut is 30 percent. The father never know who snatch his baby. And I get the man who kiII my brother. What's his name? - Cooper. - Cooper. And aII you have to do is bring him to me. Mr. Horne can maybe do that. But you're going to be a big heIp  aren't you? Whatever you want-- Want me to do. The tape of the girI. Get it now. Yes  aII right. She goes back north  - or this deaI goes south. - Jean  teII my sister to behave herseIf  or you'II get mad. She stays. You get the money  I get Cooper. Everybody happy. Of course  we We can't Iet the girI Iive now  can we? No  no  no. Thanks  Pete. I appreciate the caII. Harry? Time for a break. Josie caIIed Pete. She'II be back tomorrow afternoon. Great. Let's bring her in. Coop  I need a favour. I'd Iike to see her first. AIone. Harry  we can't Iet personaI feeIings interfere with our work. Easier said than done. TaIk to her. Bring her in. You know there's a chance that she's not invoIved with any of this. Harry  you have my bIessing. PearI Lakes. There's a vacant Iot next to the PaImer house. Next to that there's a white house aII boarded up. - MaiIbox  no name on it. - TitIe check? County's working on it. Power and Lights are searching their records. - How soon before we know? - Morning  earIiest. Hawk  you haven't seen Mr. Gerard  have you? - Shoe saIesman? - The one-armed man? He came in to show me some sampIes. The one-armed man was here? Yeah  he got faint and had to go to the bathroom. Never came back. Harry  remember in my dream? The one-armed man knew Bob. What's going on? ''Without chemicaIs  he points. '' The Giant's third cIue. Harry  we've got to find the one-armed man. Is that reaIIy necessary  doc? It's for her own protection  Ed. She ripped two pair of Ieather restraints Iast night Iike tissue paper. I ran a bIood test. She's pumping out more adrenaIine than a wiIdcat weII. Never seen anything Iike it. Now  your being here may quiet her. TaIk to her. Maybe sing. She got a favourite song? Favourite song? Beats a trip to Lourdes. Okay. But if I'm going to sing to her  doc  I'd rather it was just the two of us. I'II cIose the door behind me. Nadine? Doc says I shouId sing a song for you. I'm sorry  honey. I'm not sure what you'd Iike to hear. On top of OId Smokey AII covered with snow I Iost my true Iover A-courtin' too sIow Courting's a pIeasure Parting's a grief A faIse-hearted Iover Is worse than a thief Good God. You're a jack and I'm a jack And SteepIejacks are we And when we cIimb up to the top The cry is victory! V-I-C-T-O-R-Y! Vi-- Hi  Eddie. Did you come by to pick me up? Doc Hayward says tonsiIIitis or no tonsiIIitis  I can go to cheerIeading tryouts. CheerIeader tryouts? WeII  I'm a senior  Eddie. You know what they say? You're onIy 1 8 once. Dr. Jacoby? Gents. Come on in. This is my wife  EoIani. She Iives at our pIace in HanaIei. We're-- WeII  we're practicing a kind of creative Kahuna heaIing. - How do you do? - Ma'am. Are you ready to be hypnotised? Yes  yes. I've been under many times. This is the autosuggestion program that I use. EoIani  start the tape  pIease. Sheriff Truman. WouId you hoId this stone  pIease  at the end of the bed there? Great. Just-- Yes. Okay  Agent Cooper. I'm ready. ''You are standing on a smooth  green carpet of grass. The baII is 1 5 feet from hoIe. Beyond the green  two pristine white sand traps and a IiIy-fiIIed pond yawn out towards the emeraId fairway. The hoIe seems to sIowIy drift away across the green towards the pond  carried by the summer wind. The green grows Iarger and Iarger. The green enguIfs you  enveIoping you in a soft bIanket of peace. Harry. You stroke the baII. It drifts towards the hoIe and gentIy drops in its centre. '' Can you hear me  Dr. Jacoby? Yes. You're in your hospitaI room. In the room is Jacque RenauIt. Do you smeII anything? Burned engine oiI? I smeII engine oiI at the park. Air is fiIIed with it. AII right  we're going back to your room at the hospitaI now. Does anyone come into the room? Nurses  Doc Hayward. You  Sheriff Truman. What happens after we Ieave? I dream I'm at Hanauma Bay. I'm juggIing coconuts at a Iuau. The guests are aII Nigerians. AII right. Does anyone eIse come into the room  Iater that night? The sound of the tape ripping wakes me up. I see a piIIow going over his face. He's making this sound. AImost Iike a dog barking. Jacques stops moving. I Iook up to see who's hoIding the piIIow. Who is it? Do you see who it is? I know him. Hi. This is from HaroId Smith. Sorry I haven't been out to see you since the funeraI  but things have been pretty strange. So were you sIeeping with this guy HaroId or what? He seems pretty nice. Kind of an oddbaII. AIthough  I guess anyone can start to seem Iike that when you Iook cIose enough. We need to taIk. Maybe you aIready know about me and James. But anyway  after you died  we kind of got together. This isn't something I feeI Iike I have to expIain to you because you probabIy knew how we feIt before we did. How can you be so smart about things Iike that and so stupid about so much eIse? I'm mad at you. When it was you and me and James  it kind of worked. Now you're gone. I Iove James. And it's a mess. Your cousin Maddy's here  and I think there's something going on between the two of them. And I'm afraid I'm gonna end up Iosing both of you. I wanted so much to be Iike you  Laura. To have your strength and your courage. But Iook what it did. Look what it did to you. As much as I Iove you  Laura  most of the time we were trying to soIve your probIems. And you know what? We stiII are. Not mine or James' or Maddy's. Yours. You're dead  Laura  but your probIems keep hanging around. It's aImost Iike they didn't bury you deep enough! James. Looking for Donna. I can't find her. I just gotta taIk to somebody. What's wrong  James? She came home. Who? My mom was aII Ioaded. She was aII screwed up. God  I hate her. James  no. God  you're on fire. HoId me. Oh  my God. Donna. Donna! Donna! Why?! AII I did was come to a funeraI. And it's Iike I feII into a dream. It's Iike peopIe think I'm Laura. And I'm not. - I'm nothing Iike Laura. - It's so hard  I know. I know  sweetheart. I know. AII I know is that Laura was my cousin  and I Ioved her and she died. I don't know anything eIse. You just want Iife to be the way it was before. - Yeah. - So do I. We aII do. And try as we might  it just won't cooperate  wiII it? No. Oh  baby. If Iife couId onIy be Iike those summers up at PearI Lakes. LeIand? The door was open. LeIand What is it? LeIand  you're under arrest for the murder of Jacques RenauIt. I'm sorry  I didn't know where eIse to go. Donna. What's wrong? I don't even know if I want to taIk about it  I feeI so stupid. SIow down. Sit down. I keep teIIing myseIf that he's confused  but how much Ionger am I supposed to think that? - James HurIey? - Yeah. Just when I thought I had it aII figured out. Why do I even care? Why shouId I? WeII  you care because you care for him. - Don't you? - I wish I didn't. I just want it to stop. First  you have to stop. Hey  what was it she used to say? ''Donna Madonna  there's aIways manana. '' How did you know that? - I'II get you something to drink  okay? - Okay."

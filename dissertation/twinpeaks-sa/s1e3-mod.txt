"3","Previously We'll talk later. Albert  if you come up to Lewis Fork  I can recommend a place for lunch. - Leo called you? - He asked for the rest of the money. She was supposed to hand it over today. She checked out on us. We're lucky we're in jail. You know what's gonna go down with Leo when we get out. No! No! No  no  no  not in my room. In here  in here! - Jerry  back from Paris? - Ben  what a nightmare! Right there! No  right there. What is with you guys? I've got a sandwich in there  I want all those bags open. We're looking till we find it Hey  Audrey  Uncle Jerry's back. - Sylvia - Benjamin! OK  OK Gone! Goodbye! Brother Ben  this is the best damn sandwich I ever ate. It's a baguette with brie and butter. I had four of these every day I was there. You 've got to try this thing. Here  go ahead  eat it. Go ahead. Go ahead! Oh  yeah. This is incredible  Jer! You know what this reminds us of? You know who likes this? It reminds us of Ginny and Jenny down by the river. - My God  you 're right! - Am I right? Am I right? Oh  no wonder! Jer  outside  outside. Always a pleasure. Jerry Leland's daughter was murdered  and the Norwegians left. - Did they sign? - Deal's off. We had those Vikings by the horns! What happened? We're not a hundred percent sure  they took their translator with them. Did you say Leland's daughter was murdered? Yes. I'm depressed. I can fix that. There's a new girl at One-Eyed Jacks  freshly scented from the perfume counter. And you  brother Jer  have a 50-50 chance of being first in line. I like those odds. All work and no play make Ben and Jerry dull boys. - That's right. - Let's jump in the boat. That's great huckleberry pie  Mrs Hayward. Thank you  James. Well Mrs Hayward and I are going to say good night  James. - Good night  James. - Good night. - Good night  dear. - Good night  Mom. Don't worry about the dishes  I'll clean up. Are you coming to church with us in the morning  Donna? Yes. - Nine o'clock sharp. - OK. - Good night  James. - Good night  sir. Hi  sailor! Good evening  Mr Horne. Ben  we're not gonna go in the casino first? Jer  I didn't come here to lose my shirt  I just came to take it off. - Kim  the Horne brothers are here. - I'll tell Blackie. I'd like to order two drinks. One double scotch on the rocks. And my brother would like a double scotch on the rocks. That's two double scotch on the rocks. Next stop  rocket science. Jerry - Blackie! - Benjamin.   Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?   Thou art more lovely and more temperate   Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May   And every fair from fair sometimes declines   By chance or nature's changing course untrimm'd   But thy eternal summer shall not fade   Nor lose possession of that fair thou owest -   Nor shall death brag   - Where's the new girl? When you really want love  you 'll find it waiting for you. Heads. Come on. We'll take care of you  Jerry. Well Donna  I don't think that what we're feeling or doing is wrong. Why not? Because it's the truth. Because I think it would have turned out this way anyway. You do? Yes. I remember a time in school  in the hall. We were suddenly alone  and we looked at each other. I almost told you I loved you then. It's true. It is true  isn't it? Oh  James. I guess because of Laura I couldn't say anything. - I couldn't even let myself think it. - Me  too. Are we gonna be together  James? Are we? Are we  James? - Special Agent Dale Cooper. - Hello  it's Hawk. Deputy Hawk  how is Ronnette Pulaski? - Body and spirit are still far apart. - What did you find out? Ronnette recently quit at the perfume counter of Horne's store. Everything else is quiet  except there was a one-armed man snooping around intensive care. - A one-armed man? - Left. - Did you question him? - No. I pursued  but he got away. Maintain an around-the-clock watch on Ronnette. We'll speak in the morning. Got it? Supposed to leave it in this stupid football. Is it in there? Not all of it. Cash on delivery  Bobby. He's got a gun. - Hey  Leo. - Hey. Who's that? - Is someone with you? - Never mind. Toss it over here  quarterback. It's empty. Weren't you supposed to leave something for me? This barely covers what we paid for. Where's the rest? - Where's the rest of the money? - There's a - There's a problem. - Problem? - Laura had it. - You think you got problems? We can get it. Wait until everything settles down. You punks owe me ten grand. Leo needs a new pair of shoes. OK. We won't take delivery on the drugs until you get the cash. - Do I look like a bank? - I appreciate your position. How could I anticipate this thing with Laura? Laura was a wild girl. Tell me about it. Maybe. Someday. Take your hand out of your pocket  Mike. - What is your problem  Leo? - Problem? You want to know about problems? OK. You 're on the road  driving back and forth  gone for days. - You get back  and guess what? - What? You find out your old lady's been giving it away. - Yeah? - Yeah. Stepping out in your own damn bedroom. That's a problem. I guess so. I guess it is. - Do you know who? - A man needs a clean house. Sure. So do you know who? - I'll take care of it. - Sure. And this other thing  we'll take care of it  don't worry. We'll get the cash  and everything will be square. - Go out for a pass. - What? - Go out for a pass. - OK  just - Run. - Take it easy. Run! Run! Damn it  I'm done  Bobby. Let's get the hell out of here. - Ed! - Sorry  I didn't see it. You stepped on my drape runner! - It was in the middle of the floor. - Think that's an accident? I laid those out there myself. I was up all night working on that invention. I'm going to have the world's first - I'm real sorry  Nadine. - Ed  you make me sick! That's it! Exactly sixty feet  six inches. It's perfect. What do you think he's up to? It beats me. Invitation to love. Each day brings a new beginning  and every hour holds the promise of an invitation to love. Right. - Who is it? - The big  bad bobcat. Are you crazy? What are you doing here? I just passed Leo out in North Bend. - We've got at least twenty minutes. - Where's your car? Parked in the woods. Open Sesame! Somebody might see me out here  and that'd be worse. Bobby  you cannot come by here like this. We can't meet  for a while. What the hell happened to you? Leo Johnson happened to me. That bastard. Come here. Bobby! If he finds out about us  he's gonna kill you. He'll kill us both. If he ever does this to you again  I'll kill him. I mean it. Cup of coffee. It's not the first time  it won't be the last  but I'm in that doghouse again. What happened this time? I popped a grease gun  stepped on a drape runner  and all hell broke loose. I ran into Nadine in the hardware store. All she talked about is the drape runners. She's got one big bee in her bonnet. Bobby sure gave me a good one? - Where do you want these rocks? - There by the doughnuts  Deputy. - Anyone for a warm-up? - Oh  yeah! - You bet! - Thanks  Lucy. Damn good coffee! And hot! Would everyone please take a seat? By way of explaining what we're about to do  I am first gonna tell you a little bit about the country called Tibet. An extremely spiritual country  the leader of Tibet is known as the Dalai Lama. In 1950  communist China invaded Tibet. While leaving the Dalai Lama in charge  they seized control of the country. In 1959  after a Tibetan uprising against the Chinese  the Dalai Lama fled to India and has lived in exile ever since. Following a dream three years ago  I have become moved by the plight of the Tibetans and filled with a desire to help them. I awoke realising I had subconsciously gained knowledge of a deductive technique involving mind-body coordination operating hand in hand with the deepest level of intuition. Sheriff  Deputy Hawk  if you will please assist me  I will now demonstrate. On the day of her death Laura Palmer wrote the following in her diary    Nervous about meeting 'J' tonight.    Today we'll concentrate on the   J's  . Harry  when I give the word  would you read aloud each name I've written on the blackboard? Deputy Hawk  stand here and hold this bucket of rocks where I can get to them. Would you please put on the kitchen mittens. Deputy Andy  move down  stand by the bottle. Lucy  take this piece of chalk. Not too near  Andy! I'm getting excited. If I hit the bottle after a particular name  make a check on the name. Sheriff  when you say the name  state that person's relationship to Laura Palmer. - Ready? - Ready. James Hurley secret boyfriend. James Hurley. Josie Packard was instructed in English by Laura. Josie Packard. So there's no check next to either of these names? That's correct. Please continue. Dr Lawrence Jacoby Laura's psychiatrist. Dr Lawrence Jacoby. You did it! You hit it! Lucy  make a note that the bottle was struck  but did not break. Very important. Andy  put that bottle back exactly where it was! Johnny Horne. Laura was his special education tutor. Johnny Horne. Norma Jennings helped Laura with the meals-on-wheels programme. Norma Jennings. Shelly Johnson waitress at diner  friend. Shelly Johnson. - Sorry  Andy. - Sweetie? It didn't hurt. It didn't hurt a bit. Where there's no sense  there's no feeling  Andy. Coop Tell me The idea for all this really came from a dream? Yes. It did. Jack with One Eye Maybe it's the letter 'i'  but there's no 'i' in Jack. I think it means he only had one eye. Sounds like Nadine  Big Ed Hurley's wife. No  there's a casino up north called One-Eyed Jacks  across the border in Canada. We're gonna have to check that place out. I'm going to erase this  because it's a place  not a person. Maybe the person could be in the place. - So should I erase it? - Yes. Yes  a person could be in a place  or yes  I should erase it? Erase it  Lucy. Next name  Harry. Leo Johnson husband of Shelly  drives a truck  connection with Laura unknown. Leo Johnson. Little Audrey Horne just walked in. Yeah  I saw her at church. Wonder what she's doing down here. - Hi  Audrey. - Hi  Norma. A cup of coffee  please. Remind me to get those 60 watt bulbs. Thanks. I'm gonna go say hi. Hi. Hi  Donna. So my parents said they saw you at church today. I didn't see you. I came by because of Laura. What do you mean? I didn't think you liked her. There were things about Laura I didn't like  but she did take care of my brother Johnny. I loved her for that. Do you like coffee? Yeah  with cream and sugar. Agent Cooper loves coffee. Audrey! But Agent Cooper likes his coffee black. - Can I ask you something? - Sure. Did Laura ever talk about my father? What do you mean? Nothing. No  what do you mean? He used to sing to her. I love this music. Isn't it too dreamy? Hawk found this half a mile down the tracks from the crime site. It's a nasty piece of work. Tell Agent Cooper that Albert and his team are here. - Albert? - A-l-b-e-r-t. - Do we have to stand here all day? - No. Albert Rosenfield. R-o-s-e-n-f-i-e-l-d. Sheriff  this is Lucy. - Is Agent Cooper with you? - Yes  he is. Are Albert and his team here  Lucy? - Yes  he is they are. - We're on our way. - Agent Cooper will be right with you. - I can hear perfectly well  Curly. Albert and his team are cream of the crop. Albert's a forensics genius. I wouldn't expect anything less. But I got to warn you  Albert's lacking in some of the social niceties. - Nobody's perfect. - Isn't that the truth? What kind of a two-bit operation are they running here? Albert  this is Sheriff Truman. I've seen some slipshod backwater burgs  but this place takes the cake. What are you waiting for? Christmas? They're burying this girl tomorrow  and we've wasted half the day getting here. I suggest you and your team should get started. I'll have one of my men escort you over to the morgue. Results from the local pathologist's report. Welcome to Amateur Hour. Looks like an all-nighter  boys. Albert  got a minute? I hear that you 're real good at what you do. - That's correct. - That's good. 'Cause normally if a stranger walked into my station talking this crap  he'd be looking for his teeth two blocks up on Queer Street. Good night  Ed! - Ed  is that you? - Yeah  honey  it's me. - Ed! - Oh  my God. Oh  Ed  I'm so happy  sweetheart  I have to thank you. Why's that? You don't know what you 've done for me. - No  I don't. - Oh  Ed  you big lug! When you tracked that grease into the house today  you spilled some on my cotton balls. But instead of tossing them out  I put the greased ones on the runners. And Ed just listen to this. Completely silent. - How about that? - Oh  Ed We're gonna be so rich! Everything smells like fish around here. Well  you could wash your socks separately. What did that FBI man want up here today? Very nice fellow. Asked a few questions. About what? Well  he talked to Josie mostly. I had a problem with a fish. Took a liking to my percolator. What did he want to talk to Josie about? Why don't you ask her? Here's the key  the ledger's inside. - Thank you. - You betcha. Didn't he ask for me? Yeah  but we said you were on a world tour he should contact your press agent. Get your boots off my bed and go to your room! I didn't want to get mink oil on my bedspread. You got mink oil in your head. Two books. Leland - Leland  stop it! - We have to dance  Sarah. We have to dance for Laura. - Leland  stop it! Give it to me. - We have to dance! Leland! Leland  give it to me! What is going on? Leland! What is going on in this house? Oh  God! Laura  Laura! Laura!   Through the darkness of future past    the magician longs to see    one chance out between two worlds   fire  walk with me.    We lived among the people. I think you say  convenience store. We lived above it. I mean it like it is  like it sounds. I  too  have been touched by the devilish one. Tattoo on the left shoulder. Oh  but when I saw the face of God  I was changed. I took the entire arm off. My name is Mike. His name is Bob. Mike? Mike  can you hear me?   Catch you with my Death Bag.    You may think I've gone insane. But I promise I will kill again! But it it is Laura Palmer. Are you Laura Palmer? Harry  it's Cooper. Meet me for breakfast  I know who killed Laura Palmer. No  it can wait till morning. "

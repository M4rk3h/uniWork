"6","Diane it is 4:28 a.m. I have just been woken up by the most God-awful racket which you can probably hear over the sound of my voice. Can you hear that? Up until this moment I've experienced nothing at the Great Northern Hotel but the most pleasant courteous service imaginable. However it just goes to prove the point that once a traveler leaves his home he loses almost 100 percent of his ability to control his environment. Diane I was wondering if you could overnight express to me two pair of those Ear-Pillow silicone earplugs which I used on my last trip to New York. Naturally I didn't bring them with me on this trip because I didn't feel it would be necessary. However Coffee? Please. - What's with the choir practice? - Heh. Business junket. From Iceland. Got in about 3 this morning. Ohh. - They're on my floor. - Lucky you. It'll take them a day or two to reset their biological clocks. - Heh. Hope the herring holds out. - Mm. How are you? Well Audrey to be perfectly honest I'm tired and a little on edge. Oh. I got a job. Good for you. And I thought maybe now I could help you with your case. Guess where I'm going Audrey you'll have to excuse me this morning. I'm running late. I only have time for coffee. Well maybe I could go with you. Wednesdays were traditionally a school day when I was your age. I can't believe you were ever my age. I've got the pictures to prove it. - How old are you? - Eighteen. We'll see you later Audrey. See you later. Bye. Ha ha. I'll see you later Sons of Olden! How do you say that? My brother will love you guys. Brother Ben I bring you greetings from the fertile treeless tundra of Iceland. We have had complaints from nearly every guest in the hotel. What are they on nitrous oxide? They are insane for the Ghostwood Estates project. I have had more serious fun in two days with these Nordic animals. And Ben I'm in love. Her name is Heba. She's a giant snow queen with a smile like a sunrise on an ice floe. You could go blind looking at this girl. Look at this. You see what she gave me? An entire leg of lamb. - Jerry come on. - Is that beautiful? Come on look you crush some garlic some fresh mint that's rotisserie heaven. Come on you gotta meet her. Jerry just grab some downtime will you? We've laid in a gala reception for your fair-haired boys tonight. All of Twin Peaks' best and brightest. We're holding it in a phone booth? And if we still need a kicker to nail the sale I'm thinking that maybe they might enjoy a little road trip up to uh you-know-where. Ah? Jack's. I am honored to know you. Ben? Leland what are you doing here? Well I know there's a new investment group arriving today. If there's anything I can do Leland the best thing that you can do is follow doctor's orders. Go home. You need your rest. I just feel I just feel I need something to occupy my mind. Leland will you take some time off for God's sakes? Fly somewhere. Uh take Sarah. I'm afraid to go. I'm afraid. Hawk we're here at Jacques Renault's apartment. Get over here as soon as you can. - Morning. - Morning. What do you got Harry? Jacques Renault's a Canadian national. He worked the lumber fields this side of the border until he put on a little excess tonnage a couple of seasons ago. That's when he started bartending at the Roadhouse. Harry are there any more doughnuts? Sure. Andy. Thank you. Better wash that down with a cup a joe. I didn't get too much sleep last night. Yeah you do look a little peaked. There's a large group of insane men staying on my floor. Jacques Renault turn up? No one's seen him for two days. We've canvassed the building and the Roadhouse. - I sent Hawk to roust his brother. - I'll get back to you. But it looks like Bernie's jumped bail. There's no sign. - Morning Agent Cooper. - Morning doc. The blood on the shirt you found here is AB negative. It's not Laura's blood. So it was Jacques Renault's blood on Leo Johnson's shirt. Hmm. Hmm. Oh. Thank you Andy. Mm. What about Leo Johnson? Could you hold this? The APB went out last night. Nothing yet. - I need you to find out something. - Could you give me a leg up here? Sure. What's Jacques Renault's blood type? - Alley-oop. - Unh. Jacques Renault's blood is AB negative. Thanks doc. My pleasure. Holy smoke. Flesh World again. Yeah. Harry remember that ad with the picture of Ronette Pulaski? We traced that ad. It came into the magazine in a plain envelope no name. Well the magazine's a clearing-house. Readers write letters in response to the ads and mail them in to the magazine. The magazine forwards them on to the advertisers. No direct contact. Ronette received her letters at this post office box. That's a local ZIP code. Now my guess is that this post office box will be registered under the name of Jacques Renault. Let's see who was writing to Ronette. Postmarked Georgia. Good night. I don't know. The beard sort of ruins the effect of the lingerie. What do you think? The guy's no Georgia peach. Poor bastard. By the way Harry did you notice the picture of Leo Johnson's truck on that page? I love it when you cook for me. Leo hates my cooking. Leo missed the boat with you baby. The biggest mistake of your life was dropping out of the 11th grade and marrying that road hog. What would you do if he walked in right now? Come here. Hey Leo. How's it going man? What a surprise. Now Leo Shelly tells me that you don't like her cooking. Tell you what she and I we're gonna sit here while you cook breakfast for us you hump. And if you so much as utter one harsh syllable to this beautiful girl I'm gonna shoot your ugly face off okay man? Sheriff's deputy. Now Shelly you do exactly what we said and everything's gonna be fine. Okay? Come here. Mm. Oh hi Andy. Come on in. Hi Shelly. Do you know when Leo might be back? Is he in some kind of trouble? No we just wanna talk to him. This wouldn't be about Laura would it? Why do you say that? Well I heard him talking to this guy Jacques the night he left. Jacques Renault? Yeah. They were outside arguing. I couldn't hear exactly but they did seem to be arguing about her and then they drove off together. Shelly you call us the minute he gets in touch with you. Okay I will. Thanks for stopping by. - How'd I do? - You did great. Oh. You drive me crazy. - Hello? - Hi. Hi Leo. Where you calling from? Has anybody come by? What's that? Is anybody looking for you? Why would anybody be looking for you? Are you sure? You know how paranoid you get when you've been popping bennies on the road a couple of days. So when are you coming home? Soon. Everything okay? Yeah everything's fine Leo. Come on home. I miss you Shelly. I miss you too. Hey good-looking. Hope you don't mind my coming. Oh no. Nadine won't be back from that patent attorney over there in Fairvale for a couple of hours. Ah. The famous silent drape runners. She's already spending the millions. Well I have to put gas in my car like everyone else right? You bet. I didn't wanna tell you on the phone but Hank got his parole. Okay. He'll be coming home. I mean back. I only saw him a minute before the hearing. He seemed so hopeful. I didn't wanna say anything. You don't have to explain. Have you said anything to Nadine yet? Haven't yet. Waiting for me to go first? No. It's just that uh Nadine's not well. What are you saying? I don't know. I think I do. I don't ever wanna hurt you babe. Maybe that's our trouble Ed. We never wanna hurt anyone. We never just take what we want. There's a part of me that's beginning to think that this is how it is when you get to the end of your life and that you don't have anything to show for it. Norma. Don't call me. I mean not for a while okay? Okay. I love you Ed. I can remember when you were just a little girl. So did my father speak to you? Yes yes he did. And I can't tell you how excited we are to have you come on board and put in a hitch with us down here at our flagship. So what did you have in mind for me? Well Audrey as per your father's suggestion starting low aiming high et cetera we thought perhaps the Wrapping Department gifts et cetera. Part-time after school. No no no. Emory may I speak frankly? Oh please do. Let's talk retail. Sales? Perfume. One of our more uh sensitive areas. Expensive items delicate customer relations. I'm afraid I've got my heart set on it Emory. Heh. I'd have to talk to your father. Emory here's what we're gonna do. You're gonna tell my father that I'm busy as a bee wrapping boxes with the drones. Then you're gonna put me to work this afternoon behind the perfume counter because if you don't I'm gonna rip my dress in half and scream at the top of my lungs and tell my father that you made a pass at me. Does that help to clear things up for you? Yes. Yes what? Yes Miss Horne. Shall we get started on the paperwork? James. I got your note. Are you all right? Donna there's some things I gotta say. I told you that my dad died when I was 10. He didn't die. He was a musician. We were living on the West Coast. He was a bum and he ran off on me and my mom. I'm sorry. My mom was a writer. She was really good. Poems and short stories. She's an alcoholic. If you have a problem with this I know you didn't ask to hear it. I don't have a problem. You tell me. It's true she was out of town this week but she wasn't traveling. What she does is she goes to another town shacks up in some cheap hotel with a couple of bottles and picks up guys and It's all right. I'm telling you this because I don't wanna have any secrets from you. I don't want there to be any lies between us. It's the secrets people keep that destroy any chance they have of happiness and I don't want us to be like that. We won't. We won't be. We have to do what's right. What you said yesterday was true. If we don't do everything we can to figure out what happened to Laura it'll never go away our whole lives. We will James. She's out there wandering like a restless spirit. I feel it too. We owe it to her. At least they're fresh. Here you go Gary. Oh thanks. - Here you go Scott. - Thank you. There you are. What do you wanna mark this? Mark it duplicate. Do we have one like it? Yeah the same stain. We had it before. Mark it duplicate. Hmm. Red drapes. That PO Box was registered to Jacques Renault. Those are the letters responding to Ronette's ad in the magazine. Let's see if there's something from someone we know. Hawk hand me that magazine would you? What is it? Two different ad numbers mailed to the same post office address. Ronette's and one other. Yeah here it is.   Young student requires education in the ways of love. Only generous mature men need apply.    It's Laura. You see some identifying mark? - The drapes. - Drapes? Red drapes Harry from my dream. Now why would an apartment dweller like Jacques buy 50 gallons of heating oil? Yeah yeah I already got it. To heat a log cabin. Harry you're all right. Jacques' brother said something about a place up near the state line. Fellas let's pack a lunch. We're taking a walk in the woods. Madeleine. - Hi. - Hi. Hi. I'm Madeleine Ferguson. My friends call me Maddy. This is really nice of you guys. I don't really know anybody in town except Aunt Sarah and Uncle Leland. And the mood at the house you can probably guess isn't that great right now. Would you like something to drink? A cherry Coke would be great. You got it. Madeleine. If I said that you can't really say a word of this to anyone not a soul not even your aunt or uncle would that be okay with you? It sounds like some big secret. It is. James and I knew Laura better than anyone did. She was in some kind of terrible trouble before she died worse than any of us could imagine. What? Well I'd rather not say too much about things we can't prove yet. You said you can't prove it yet. We loved Laura. We're afraid that the truth might never come out or that the person who killed her might never be caught. We've sworn on her memory not to let that happen. My God. You know who did it? We have some ideas. We wanted to talk to you about this because we need your help. What do you want me to do? Laura used to talk about a secret hiding place she had somewhere in her house maybe in her room. I'm not really sure. But nobody else knew about it. We think she might have left something there that could lead us to the killer. I'll help you. You will? The day before she died I had a feeling that Laura was in trouble. I've always felt close to her. That's why I came here. You know I didn't really know Laura that well but I feel like I do. Our folks were always telling us how much alike we were. Will you call me if there's anything I can do? I don't think there'll be any problem. This is really great. Call me Maddy. - Hi. - Hi Norma. We look like a couple of refugee beauty queens. You don't know how really good-looking you are. I never felt so glamorous. Hope I don't chip a nail slinging plates around. Hi Norma. Hello Hank. Surprised to see me huh? Yes. Is that Leo's girlfriend? Wife. That Leo. So impulsive. Not much meat on her though. Hey I don't expect a kiss or anything. I figure I gotta earn my way back into your heart. But Norma I intend to try. So where do I start? Washing dishes will be fine. Can I finish my coffee first boss? Oh no. Oh no. No. You little Froot Loop. You're done! Done! Don't ever cross me. Tune in tomorrow for Invitation to Love. He's been spending more and more of his time alone in his room. It's become much more difficult to engage him in conversation. Terrible mood swings. We've been told by the school that his attendance has become erratic at best. And then there's the matter of public fighting both at the Roadhouse and at the funeral. Are you using drugs Bobby? Nope. - Alcohol. - Alcohol's a drug. - Well that's not what he meant. - Alcohol doesn't count? Everybody drinks. Are you unhappy Bobby? Shouldn't I be? Well that's not for me to say. Have you ever killed anybody? - Have you? - My father has. - During wartime. - That's different. Different from what? Perhaps I should spend a few minutes with Bobby alone. This is supposed to be family counseling. Well and I'll need to spend some time with each member of the family alone but Bobby first. - Fair enough. - Whatever you say. Bobby let's just cut the crap huh? Okay so your parents don't understand what you're going through right now. Heh. That's a good one. Let's talk about Laura. Okay. Let's talk about Laura. Bobby what happened the first time that you and Laura made love? What the hell kind of question is that? Bobby did you cry? Did I what? And then what did Laura do? Did she laugh at you? Were you very sad when Laura died? - Laura wanted to die. - How do you know that? Because she told me. What else did she tell you? Did she tell you there was no goodness in the world? She said people tried to be good but they were really sick and rotten her most of all. And every time she tried to make the world a better place something terrible came up inside her and pulled her back down into hell. It took her deeper and deeper into the blackest nightmare. And every time it got harder to go back up to the light. Did you sometimes have the feeling that Laura was harboring some awful secret? Yeah. Bad enough that she wanted to die because of it? Yes. Bad enough that it drove her to consciously try to find people's weaknesses and prey on them tempt them break them down make them do terrible degrading things? - Yes. - Laura wanted to corrupt people. Because that's how she felt about herself. Yes. Is that what happened to you Bobby? Is that what Laura did to you? She wanted so much. She made me sell drugs so she could have them. This way. Through here. Watch your step there city boy. Thanks Harry. What is it Hawk? Is that the cabin we're looking for? Maybe maybe not. You might wanna hang back a step doc. Huh. Might want to anyway. About time you got here. They move so slowly when they're not afraid. Come on then. My log does not judge. I've got tea. I've got cookies. No cake. Well that's very kind of you ma'am but I don't believe that What kind of cookies? Sugar. The owls won't see us in here. A cup of tea would be very nice. Shut your eyes and you'll burst into flames. Thanks Margaret. We'll let it steep. Wait for the tea. The fish aren't running. You've been expecting us Margaret? You're two days late. But that's your concern. My log saw something. Something significant. What did your log see? Tea first. Then be ready. Thank you. - My husband was a logging man. - Oh? He met the devil. Fire is the devil hiding like a coward in the smoke. It was the day after the wedding wasn't it Margaret? The wood holds many spirits doesn't it Margaret? You can ask it now. What did you see that night? The night Laura Palmer was killed? Shh. I'll do the talking. Dark. Laughing. The owls were flying. Many things were blocked. Laughing. Two men. Two girls. Flashlights pass by in the woods over the ridge. The owls were near. The dark was pressing in on her. Quiet then. Later footsteps. One man passed by. Screams far away. Terrible. Terrible. One voice. - Man or girl? - Girl. Further up. Over the ridge. The owls were silent. The two girls were Laura and Ronette. The two men Jacques maybe Leo. Maybe. Who's the third man? Do you hear it? This way. And there's always music in the air. Waldo. There's film in here. Blood. One-Eyed Jack's. Evening Mr. and Mrs. Showel. - Okay. Go right ahead. - Thank you. Good evening. - Catherine Martell and spouse. - Mm-hm. Go easy on the sauce tonight okay Cathy? Couple of belts and even you might start to look good to me. Of course the modern age has changed forever the way your people live Mr. Thorson. But it would be my guess that there still remains a tremendous vestigial interest in the legends and folklore of ancient Iceland. Vestigial. Absolutely. Heba did you know that was an American figure of speech? No Jerry. Ha ha. Heba Heba. You never heard that before? No Jerry. Ha-ha-ha. Do you realize the incredible potential that could result from our taking a mutual dip in each other's respective gene pools? Heba I wanna cook for you. Very very good. That's funny. So he says   What do you get when you cross a Norwegian with a Swede? A socialist who wants to be king.    Well I can remember it was I think oh somewhere in the '50s I came through your country. Beautiful beautiful. Not many trees though you know but Hmm. Would you excuse me? Of course. Meet me in my office. Give me two minutes to break away. - Hell hath no fury. - What? Two minutes. Ah Thor I've been meaning to ask you are you familiar with the word luhamsta? Catherine we agreed no scenes in front of the guests. Let's keep the melodrama to a minimum. The next thing I know you're polishing my shoes with Dom Pérignon. Fill me in. What's eating you? Why did you have this thousand-dollar poker chip from you-know-where in your pants yesterday? I thought you preferred women with certain experience. Hmm. Jerry gave me that. It's a good-luck charm. I thought I'd lost it. I'm so relieved that you found it. Are you quite finished? Yes. In that case Oh. Let's burn the mill. Let's do it tonight. No my love. We'll give Josie one last chance to sell. Tomorrow. Failing that I have retained the services of a qualified professional. Breath mint? Now let me get this straight. Your entire country is above the timberline? Folks ladies and gentlemen can I have your attention please? Can I have your attention? Heh. First off I wanna thank you all for turning out to welcome our neighbors from the magical isle of Iceland. We are all Icelanders. The Ghostwood Estates project is an important part of our future here in Twin Peaks and there's no one we'd rather have as partners in our future than What? Dance with him. It is serious. Dance with him. All right. Jerry what's going on? Get Jacoby get a net but get him out of my life. What are they doing? Jerry. Jerry. Gather round. Donna? It's Maddy. I was looking in Laura's room and I remembered when we were younger she used to hide cigarettes in her bedpost. The top of one of the posts screws off. I found a tape in her hiding place. Leland? Where did you go? I'll meet you and James tomorrow. - Okay. And bring a tape recorder. - Leland? Did anyone see you come in here? No. You do realize the risk if anyone sees us. This was hidden in her desk where you said it would be. - Then we can proceed. - When? Tomorrow night. Over here. Told you to mind the store Leo not open your own franchise. - Hank I - Do as you're told Leo. Next time you'll watch me take your little chippy apart before I kill you. Get me a beer Shelly. Honey what happened? Are you okay? - Just get me a damn beer! - Aah! Get up and What the hell are you doing with that? You're not gonna hurt me again. Don't touch me. Don't come near me Leo. You stupid little slut. You haven't got the guts. Reach over and turn on the light. Don't make me leave. Please don't make me leave. "

"7","Everything's set. They're waiting for us at the Great Northern. Yeah  a large house made of wood  surrounded by trees. The house is filled with many rooms each alike  but occupied by different souls night after night. - The guests will be in the lobby? - Full cooperation. Hawk  you got that warrant for Harold Smith's apartment? On my way as soon as I finish my coffee. Hawk  Gordon has mentioned pages-- What I mentioned were pages found near the bloody towel down the train tracks from the crime site were from a diary. Donna Hayward spoke of Harold Smith having a secret diary of Laura Palmer's. Could be important. Let me know what you dig up. Gordon  I understand you're--? Gordon  I understand you're on your way to Bend  Oregon? I'm over to Bend  Oregon  official business  real hush-hush. Good luck to all of you. - Coop. - Gordon. Take good care of Mike. It was real nice meeting you fellas. - Sheriff. - Safe journey  chief. Thanks. No. No. No. No. No. No. Sheriff? Sheriff! Sheriff  what's the meaning of this? What the hell is going on here? Will somebody please tell me what the hell is happening here? What in the hell is going on? Mr. Smith. Harold Smith? Morning. - Good morning  dear. - Good morning  Maddy. Uncle Leland. Aunt Sarah. Sit. Oh  good  you got some coffee. Good. - Did you sleep well? - Very well. Thanks. I've been thinking. I've really enjoyed my stay and everything. But I really feel like it's time for me to go home now. To Missoula. I've got my job and my apartment. And I just miss having a life of my own. So I think I'll probably be driving back home tomorrow. Tomorrow? Well  we are going to miss you very much. - But we also understand completely. - You do? - We do. - We do. Yes  we do. You have been such a wonderful help. Yes  but now she has to think about herself  honey. She's got her own life. Besides  you'll come back and visit  won't you? Oh  of course. I'll come galloping back often. It's not like Missoula was at the far end of the universe. - No. - Hardly. Well  good then. It's all right. Just know that we love you very much. I love you too. - Hey  what's that  a note? - Yeah. ""I'm a Ionely soul. "" Poor guy. It's a good thing Andy didn't see this one. Oh  yeah. Take a look at this. ""This is the diary of Laura Palmer. "" Pay dirt. Well  we have bills here that total $1 014. Including the insurance money that leaves you with Forty-two dollars. - Forty-two dollars. - That's a good start. Forty-two dollars for the month? How am I gonna make it? How are we supposed to survive on $42 a month? We? Shelly  I can't keep telling my mom and dad that I'm spending the night at Mike's. What time is it? I'm missing Economics as it is. ""We"" meant me and Leo. Bobby  you said you were gonna take care of us. I am  Shelly. I am. I want you to take the necklace back. We don't have to do that. I want you to take the necklace back. We need the money. Shelly  you're gonna keep this necklace. When am I ever gonna feel glamorous enough to wear it? Giving Leo a bath? Feeding him his oatmeal? What about his truck? He's not gonna be cannonballing down the highway anytime soon. - The police impounded it. - We can get it back. They said if it was used in the commission of a crime it becomes property of the state. - He wasn't charged with anything. - I didn't make the rules. Okay  okay. It's like you're blaming me for something. I'm not blaming you. Come on. Take it easy. Leo was into a lot of different stuff with a lot of different people. He was in it for the money. Bobby  look around you. You really think that Leo had money? Yes  I do. Having a look at this chequebook  I don't think he ever stepped foot into a bank. He must have been hiding it somewhere. He's alive. New shoes. Bobby  he's alive. - He ain't alive  Shelly. - But he talked. It's only-- That was a burp. He probably has gas. You call that a burp? New shoes. Did he buy any shoes lately by any chance? No. He had me take in a pair of boots for repair. - When? - Last week. - Have you got a receipt? - Yeah  why? I don't know. Shelly  go get that receipt. New shoes. Want some new shoes  Leo? Give us what we want  I'll buy you the whole damn shoe store. New shoes. Daddy  I know about One-Eyed Jack's. I'm sure I don't know what you're talking about. I know about Blackie  I know about Emory Battis  I know about Ronnette  and I know about Laura. Okay. I was there. I saw you. You remember Prudence? I wore a little white mask. I need to ask you some questions. Ask away. How long have you owned One-Eyed Jack's? Five years. Did you know Laura worked there? She was only there for a brief time. - Did you know? - Yes. Did you in any way encourage her to work there? No. I had no idea. She asked if she could work in the department store. Battis sent her without my knowing. Did you sleep with her? Did you? Yes. Did you kill her? I loved her. Norma  can I talk to you for a second? Sure. What's up? With Leo coming home and all I'm supposed to be there to watch him. And it looks like it's gonna be a full-time thing. So I was thinking that I have to quit my job. Just for a little while anyway. I'm sorry. I promised myself I wasn't gonna do this. It's all right  sweetheart. I just feel so bad. I love you  and I love working here. I don't wanna let you down. You're not gonna let me down. I'm not? Look  Shelly  you've got your own life to worry about. I'll be fine here. - Are you sure? - Yes. Now  you look after yourself. When you're ready  you can come right back. It'll be like you haven't even missed a day. You'll let me come back? You just try to take a job someplace else and see what happens. I don't know what to say. Don't say anything. And I told him I'd been travelling with my parents  but now I wanted to register for spring semester. Oh  Eddie  let's sit at the counter. I'm just dying for a chocolate shake  aren't you? Hi  Norma. Say  how long have you been working here? Well  it's 20 years this April. Oh  you kidder. What a kidder. Well  it's been about six weeks  isn't that right  Norma? About six weeks. - Oh  yeah  that's right. - Well  you see? When your parents drag you off to Europe or someplace for a month  then  when you get back  it's like you've been away forever. Two chocolate shakes  please  Norma. - Coffee for me. - Extra whipped cream on mine. Hi. - What's your name? - Shelly. Are you in our class at school? I don't think so. I'll get the shake and coffee. - Europe? - Yeah. My parents loved it so much they're still there. Can you believe it? And they said it was okay for me to stay over at Eddie's. Is it your parents' house or mine  Eddie? That's right. Oh  say  Norma  you're not mad or anything because Eddie's sort of taking me out  are you? You and Ed? No. No. Why should I be? Oh  no reason. Eddie told me you broke up. It's just that I'm just so sweet on him. - Isn't he just the dreamiest? - Nadine. I can't wait for the start of football season. - Can you? - No. Can't wait. Me neither. I am just so happy. - Oh  Nadine. - Oh  God  I'm sorry. - How'd you do that? - There goes another one. There must've been a crack in this glass from before. - Golly. - Don't count on it. I'm so clumsy lately. I can hardly believe it. Shelly  get those Band-Aids  and I'll get a towel. Oh  Eddie. I am so happy I could just kiss you to death. Oh  boy  Nadine. I think she's at the diner. Shelly. Shelly. There he is  Mike. The late Leo Johnson. - Hank did this? - He sure as hell did. He shot him through that window right there. Leo  I went to the shoe shop. I showed them the ticket  and look what they gave me. - New shoes. - No  you knucklehead  old shoes. Leo  he gets pretty fixated. I hope he gets permanently fixated. I know you too damn well  Leo. Something about these shoes  isn't there? There's something with these shoes. I heard about people  you know  muling stuff in their boot. What  do you think I didn't check these out? Would you get a hammer? Don't go anywhere  Leo. Oh  my God. - What is that  a tape? - Don't. Quit spitting  man. Well  it's not money. But who knows? Diane  it's 2:47 p. m. I'm in the conference room at the sheriff's station with the remains of Laura Palmer's secret diary. A great deal of it has been mutilated. Much of what I've been able to decipher supports the contention of the one-armed man. There are repeated references to a Bob. He was a threatening presence in her life from early adolescence. There are intimations of abuse and molestation on a regular basis. He is referred to  on more than one occasion  as a friend of her father's. And I just uncovered this entry dated less than two weeks before her death: ""Someday I'm gonna tell the world about Ben Horne. I'm gonna tell them who Ben Horne really is. "" Yes? - Audrey. - I had to see you. - I'm sorry if I'm interrupting you. - How are you feeling? - I spoke with my father. - Yeah? He was sleeping with her. With Laura. I don't know for how long  maybe quite a while. Holy smokes. She was up at One-Eyed Jack's  working there. And he owns the place  that's what I found out. - He told you this? - Yes. What are you gonna do? Harry. What are you gonna do? Are you gonna arrest him? Okay  I don't want you to say a word about this to anyone. - Okay. - Okay. Now  go on home. What's going on? Without chemicals he points. This morning at the Great Northern  Mike reached for his arm and fainted just when a certain person walked into the room. Harry  we need a warrant. A warrant for the arrest of Benjamin Horne. Good news  Mr. Tojamura. My brother  Jerry  spoke to your people in Osaka  checked your references at the Tokyo bank  and the answer to your proposal  my good friend  is a big thumbs up. We appreciate your promptness. Speaking for the entire community of Twin Peaks  I cannot tell you how pleased we are to welcome you into the Ghostwood fold. Thank you so much. - Contract. For your perusal. - And a fast approval l-- Sheriff. - What is this? - This is police business. We'd like you to come with us. Fine. I happen to be in a meeting. Could you be a little more specific? You're wanted for questioning in the murder of Laura Palmer. Is that specific enough for you? You're insane. Insane. Mr. Tojamura  I'm sure that this is some dreadful mistake. You can come quietly or we can drag you through your lobby in handcuffs. Cooper  is this some sort of sick joke? Because if it is  I know people in high places. You'd better do what he says. Go away. Get out of here. Go on  go on. I'm gonna go out for a sandwich. No! No! No! No! No! No! No! You-- No! You can't do this to me. - It's already done. - You-- Leland. Take him down to the holding cell.

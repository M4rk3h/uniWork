"9","The short answer is  this is the work of the same ghoul who killed Laura. More fan mail. The letter O under Maddy's ring fingernail. There were strands of fur clutched in her right hand. - What kind of fur? - White fox. The strands were laced with formaldehyde. A dead animal  stuffed. I'll make phone calls. Leland will know how to get a hold of Maddy's family. Harry  don't make any calls. - I need 24 hours. - For what? To finish this. Cooper. In observation I don't know where this is headed. But the only one of us with coordinates for this destination and its hardware is you. Go on whatever vision quest you require. Stand on the rim of the volcano  stand alone and do your dance. Just find this beast before he takes another bite. God help me  I don't know where to start. You're on the path. You don't need to know where it leads. Just follow. I thought you'd never get here. I went for a ride this morning. God  the engine sounded like a thousand people singing. - What were they singing about? - What do you think? Last night? I could sing about last night. I got something for you. Open it. Oh  James. I didn't know what size to get. And the girl at the jewellery store had these really big hands. But I'll bet Perfect. James. I just think we should be together all the time. Really? If that's okay with you. It's perfect. Whatever fowl did you take these eggs from? Are we saying we don't like it? I'm afraid I'm gonna run into a thumbtack. Mother  can't you ever say anything nice? I've tried so hard. I've tried so hard and nothing is good enough for you. Let me correct myself  nothing I do is ever good enough for you. Well  that's not true. The menus are very presentable. Oh  I'm joking. Honestly  let me make a suggestion. If you wanna serve a truly memorable omelette try white veal sausage and morel mushrooms. Thanks. I'll go pick the mushrooms. What did you say? Nothing. Hello  Donna. Hello  James. What did you say? - It's French. - I know it is  tell me. Donna  what's the big deal? You know Mrs. Tremond? - Miss who? - Mrs. Tremond. Her grandson does the magic tricks. He told me this. But it was Mr. Smith. - Harold? - He left a suicide note. You know  it means  ""I am a Ionely soul. "" I have to find Agent Cooper. Donna  what's going on? Hey. Mrs. Tremond's the one who told me about Harold Smith. She has a grandson and he said this to me. The same words that are in Harold Smith's suicide note. Maybe the boy said the same thing to Harold. No  Harold's world was in his words. The suicide note has to be a message. It all leads back here. She's pretty old. It might take a second if her grandson isn't here. - May I help you? - Is Mrs. Tremond home? I'm Mrs. Tremond. It must have been your mother I spoke to. My mother? She passed away three years ago. I live here alone  honey. No  she was here. I spoke to her. And her grandson  he was here too. But I have no children. But he was here. They both were. Donna  we'd better go. Donna? Are you Donna Hayward? - Yeah. - Just a moment. I've never seen her before in my life. I thought you delivered meals here. The morning after poor Harold died  I found this in my mail. I meant to turn it in. It's for you. Thank you. - It's Harold's handwriting. - Open it  Donna. It's Laura's diary  a page from her diary. Read it. ""February 22nd. Last night I had the strangest dream. I was in a red room with a small man dressed in red and an old man sitting in a chair. I tried to talk to him. I wanted to tell him who Bob is because I thought he could help me. But my words came out slow and odd. It was frustrating trying to talk. I got up and walked to the old man. Then I leaned over and whispered the secret in his ear. Somebody has to stop Bob. Bob's only afraid of one man  he told me once. A man named Mike. I wonder if this was Mike in my dream. Even if it was only a dream  I hope he heard me. No one in the real world would believe me. February 23rd. Tonight is the night that I die. I know I have to because it's the only way to keep Bob away from me. The only way to tear him out from inside. I know he wants me  I can feel his fire. But if I die  he can't hurt me anymore. "" Laura and I had the same dream. - That's impossible. - Yes  it is. Deputy  take Donna home. I got to see Gerard. He's completely dehydrated. His breathing is becoming more difficult. He needs that drug. Mike. Mike  I need you to talk to me. - Any longer could kill him. - Mike. Bob has killed again. I need to know something. I need you to help me. Bob was in my dream  Laura Palmer was in my dream  so were you. And Laura dreamt about me the night before she died. The same dream that I had. I need to unlock that. I need-- The answer is inside of me. Bob and I  when we were killing together  there was this perfect relationship  appetite  satisfaction  a golden circle. A golden circle. A ring. My ring. I gave my ring to the Giant. He is known to us here. Then he's real? As real as I. He can help you find Bob. - How? - You must ask him first. How do I do that? Oh  you have all the clues you need. The answer is not here my friend. The answer is here. I don't understand. So much responsibility. I know about you. That milk will cool down on you but it's getting warmer now. ""Getting warmer now. "" I want you to tag everything in these drawers. Everything. Coop  we found his telephone records. Look at this. The night Laura died. The phone call Leland told us about. Ben called her number from this office. White fox. Yeah  white  dead and stuffed. Maddy was here. I think Ben killed her in this office and then took her to the waterfall. He killed Laura and he killed Maddy. Madeleine Ferguson died the night before last between 10 p. m. And midnight. That fits. We didn't take Ben in until after midnight. That's as close as I can cut it. Ben Horne's blood test. A couple of minutes  I'll have this up to code. Tweaking the sensors  mostly. Don't want your sprinklers to be overly jumpy. Gotta set it just so. I wanna talk about my child  our baby. - Maybe. - Maybe what? Maybe it is our baby and maybe it isn't. Dick? Oh  my Lord  is he the father? At first I thought you were the father. But then you said you didn't have any sperms. Then I thought it was Dick but now you say your sperms are back. So as far as I can tell  it's a 50-50 proposition. Andy  where are you going? What are you doing? Who are you calling? I want to speak to Richard Tremayne  Men's Fashions. Yes  I'll hold. You won't hurt him  will you  Andy? Tremayne  Brennan. Andy Brennan. We need to talk. That is  if you're not too busy. Tojamura-san. How nice of you to come calling. You are in prison. Yes  well  a momentary inconvenience  I assure you. We have papers to sign. The Ghostwood contracts. Tojamura-san  I'm afraid there has been a snag. A snag? Unforeseen difficulties. Some legal in nature  others I'm unable to sign the Ghostwood agreement at this time. Then you will return my five million dollars. Well  I want to return your money. I want to sign the contracts. Tojamura-san  as you can see  I am incarcerated. Falsely accused  but my brother  the boy genius  is out looking for a better lawyer. And until justice is done  until I am able to breathe the air that free men breathe  I plead with you for understanding. This is the long  dark night of my soul. Time to seek that tiny flickering flame within. Forgive me  I've been very emotional lately. Catherine? Benjamin Horne. You're a slimy rat bastard. And I intend to make whatever remains of your pathetic existence a living hell. Oh  Catherine. Oh  my God. You've come. Oh  Catherine. Catherine  Catherine  tell Sheriff Truman about the night that we spent together the night that Laura was killed. You want me to beg? You want me to beg? Because I'll beg. Will you sign Ghostwood and the mill over to me? In a heartbeat. Clever disguise  Catherine. Really brilliant. Signed  sealed and delivered. Now  you'll tell the sheriff  huh? You'll tell the sheriff. I'll consider it. Catherine. Catherine  wait a minute. Wait a minute. It's the truth  after all. Why  Ben  we've spent our entire adult lives lying to each other. Why spoil it with the truth now? Catherine. Catherine. Catherine! Donna  I'm so happy you stopped by. We haven't had the time to just sit down and talk for so long. May I get you a glass of lemonade? No  thanks  Mr. Palmer. I only have a minute. This is for Maddy. It's a tape of a song we did with James. I want her to have a copy. That's very sweet of you. She told me all about this. She said it was a very enjoyable experience. Anyway  if you could mail it to her  I'd really appreciate it. No  it won't be any problem at all. Is something wrong? No. Those glasses. They were Laura's. Maddy gave them to me. I thought they looked familiar. Mr. Palmer  did you know that they found Laura's secret diary? Diary? Yes  they took it from her room. No  not the one the police found. She had another one. I didn't even know about it  did you? No. She gave it to a man named Harold Smith. Harold killed himself a few days ago. The police found it in his apartment. Oh  my God. I had no idea. I wish I knew what was in it  don't you? I think about Laura all the time. Oh  excuse me. Hello? Yeah  Beth  how are you? No  not since yesterday. Of course  Beth. I took Maddy to the bus station myself. Well  l-- I'm sure there must be some perfectly reasonable explanation. Yes  of course. I'll call you immediately  within the hour. Bye  Beth. Maddy? It's the strangest thing. She never made it home. Oh  God. Donna  don't you worry about a thing. I'll get us some lemonade and we'll sit down and give it a think and we'll work the problem out. Together. I knew she was expecting us  I mean-- I guess I was selfish. I thought I could see her anytime. Missoula's not that far away  right? Donna  you're taking this much too much to heart. I'm sure she's just fine. I know the cure for what ails you. It's simple  really. It always makes me feel good. May we have this dance please? You stay right there. Harry? Leland  we need your help. What is it? - There's been another murder. - Oh  my God. I can't tell you why or how but we need your help and we need it right away. All right  anything  certainly. Let me get my coat. Maddy. What's the matter? What's wrong? - It's Maddy. - What about her? She's dead. It's the same killer. The same one who killed Laura. I heard Mr. Palmer get a phone call from her mother. She said she hadn't gotten home yet. Then they came over to talk to him  Sheriff Truman. - We could've helped her. - How? - We could've helped her. - How? I don't know. - This is no good. - What do you mean? You mean us? - I gotta go. - James  it's not our fault  don't leave. It doesn't matter  don't you see? Nothing we do matters. Nothing's ever gonna change. It doesn't matter if we're happy and the rest of the world goes to hell. James  don't leave. James  don't leave me! Harry. Leland. Why are we here  Agent Cooper? Is someone meeting us? Yes. Is it the killer? I don't know. Maybe. Ed  glad you're here. I need everyone's help to clear the room. I need a large space in the centre. Of course. Hail  hail. The gang's all here. Bobby  why don't you wheel Leo back over there. Stay very  very quiet  you read me? Give yourself a raise  Hawk. Gentlemen  two days ago a young woman was found murdered by the same individual  I believe  responsible for the death of Laura Palmer. I have reason to believe that the killer is in this room. As a member of the Bureau  I spend most of my time seeking simple answers to difficult questions. In the pursuit of Laura's killer  I have employed Bureau guidelines  deductive technique  Tibetan method  instinct and luck. But now I find myself in need of something new  which for lack of a better word we shall call ""magic. "" Would you like us to hum? A Tibetan chant  perhaps. I think it's going terrifically well  don't you? Now what? Harry  I'm not completely sure. Someone is missing. Excuse us. Major Briggs  right on time. I was on my way home. This kind gentleman flagged me down  asked if I could drive him here. I know that gum. I used to chew it when I was a kid. That's my most favourite gum in the world. That gum you like is going to come back in style. My father killed me. Ben Horne  I would like you to accompany me to the sheriff's station. You might like to bring along Leland Palmer as your attorney. Let's take him down to interrogation. Agent Cooper  is he going to be charged? Yes. Then I think I'd like to begin bail proceedings as soon as possible. He'll have his day in court. Harry. Everything will be all right  Ben. Hawk  take Ben upstairs and release him. - Leland? - That's not Leland. How did you know? Laura told me in her dream. We're gonna need a lot stronger evidence than this. How about a confession  Harry? You have the right to an attorney. If you cannot afford an attorney  one will be appointed for you. Oh  yeah. I suppose you wanna ask him some questions  huh? Did you kill Laura Palmer? That's a yes. How about Madeleine Ferguson? - What do you think? - I'm asking you. - What do you think? - Answer the question. Oh  gosh  gee  gee whiz. I guess I kind of sort of did. I have this thing for knives. Just like what happened to you in Pittsburgh that time. Huh  Cooper? Oh  Leland. Leland  Leland. You've been a good vehicle and I've enjoyed the ride. But now he's weak and full of holes. It's almost nearly time to shuffle off to Buffalo. Does Leland know what you've done? Leland's a babe in the woods with a large hole where his conscience used to be. And when I go  children  I will pull that ripcord and you watch Leland  remember. Watch him. But not for long. That's enough for me. Dick  could you come with me  please? Okay  here's how this is going to work. I'm going to keep my baby. That's not open for discussion. - I see. - Be quiet  let her talk. Got a light? No. You were saying. There's only one way to handle this. They have a test to determine the blood type of the father. It could be you or it could be you. They won't be doing this test until after the baby is born  during which time I expect complete cooperation from each of you two gentlemen. Whatever you say  Lucy. I mean  it is your baby. Thank you. Ben Horne's blood test  he's the wrong type. Harry  the answer was right in front of me from the very beginning. What did the little man do in my dream? He danced. After Laura's death  Leland danced compulsively. We were told that Bob the killer was a grey-haired man. When Leland killed Jacques  his hair turned grey overnight. Leland said when he was a child the grey-haired man next door was named Robertson. Mike said the people Bob inhabited were his children. Robertson  son of Robert. The letters under the finger nails: R  O  B  T. Bob was spelling his name. A signature on a demon self-portrait. Why would he kill her? Laura was writing about Bob in her diary. Leland found it  ripped out the pages. She knew he was on to her. It was Leland who placed that call from Ben Horne's office to Laura the night she died. He was the third man outside Jacques' cabin. He took the girls to the train car. It was his blood we found not Ben Horne's. - Then why kill Maddy? - Maybe she reminded him of Laura. Maddy was going home. He couldn't bear to part with her. He wanted to relive the experience or maybe she realized Bob was the killer and he found out. Now  this Bob. He can't really exist. I mean  Leland is just crazy  right? Through the dark of futures past  the magician longs to see One chants out between two worlds Fire walk with me I'll catch you with my death bag. You may think I've gone insane but I promise I will kill again! Harry  hurry. The key. Leland. Leland. Harry. Leland. Call an ambulance. Oh  God  Laura. I killed her. Oh  my God. I killed my daughter. I didn't know. Laura  forgive me. Forgive me. - Oh  God. - It's okay. It's all right. I was just a boy. I saw him in my dreams. He said he wanted to play. He opened me and I invited him and he came inside me. He went inside? When he was inside  I didn't know. And when he was gone  I couldn't remember. He made me do things terrible things. He said he wanted lives  he wanted others. Others that they could use like they used me. Like Laura? They wanted her. They wanted Laura  but she was strong. She fought them. She wouldn't let them in. Oh  God. They had me kill that girl  Theresa. And they-- They said if I didn't give them Laura  they'd have me kill her too. But she wouldn't let them in? She said she'd die before she let them. And they made me kill her. Oh  God  have mercy on me. What have I done? What have I done? Oh  God  I love her. I loved her with all my heart. My angel  forgive me. Leland. Leland  the time has come for you to seek the path. Your soul has set you face to face with a clear light and you are now about to experience it in its reality  wherein all things are like the void and cloudless sky and the naked  spotless intellect is like a transparent vacuum without circumference or centre. Leland  in this moment  know yourself and abide in that state. Look to the light  Leland. Find the light. I see it. Into the light  Leland. Into the light. I see her. She's there. Into the light  Leland. She's beautiful. Into the light. Laura. Don't be afraid. He was completely insane. Think so? But people saw Bob. People saw him in visions: Laura  Maddy  Sarah Palmer. Gentlemen  there's more in heaven and earth than is dreamt up in our philosophy. Amen. Well  I've lived in these old woods most of my life. I've seen some strange things but this is way off the map. I'm having a hard time believing. Harry  is it easier to believe a man would rape and murder his own daughter? Any more comforting? No. An evil that great in this beautiful world finally  does it matter what the cause? Yes  because it's our job to stop it. Yeah. Maybe that's all Bob is. The evil that men do. Maybe it doesn't matter what we call it. Maybe not. But if he was real  if he was here  and we had him trapped and he got away  where's Bob now?"

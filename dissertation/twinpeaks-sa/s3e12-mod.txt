"12","[electricity crackling] [atmospheric music] [Julee Cruise's Falling playing] [wine pouring] Thank God Gordon stocks the plane from his own wine cellar. No, you'll be the one to tell her. Ignore the strange man. [chuckles] [clears throat] - Here's to the bureau. - [Albert] To the bureau. To the bureau. [glasses clinking] Albert. Gordon. [dial clicking] Okay, here's what you need to know. Please speak succinctly, and do not make any loud, sharp noises. In 1970, the United States Air Force shut down Project Blue Book, their 20-year investigation into UFOs. They concluded that no credible evidence existed and therefore they posed no threat to national security. In other words, a massive cover-up. Cheers. Hmm. Cheers. A few years later, the military and FBI formed a top secret task force to explore the troubling abstractions raised by cases Blue Book failed to resolve. We called it the Blue Rose after a phrase uttered by a woman in one of these cases just before she died which suggested these answers could not be reached except by an alternate path we've been traveling ever since. Gordon suggested an agent by the name of Phillip Jeffries to head the squad. He soon recruited three others: myself, Chet Desmond, and Dale Cooper. Perhaps you haven't failed to notice that I'm the only one of that group who hasn't disappeared without explanation, which has led to a certain reluctance on Gordon's part to bring new blood into the fold until tonight. Agent Preston, you've been on our radar since you made the honors list at George Washington High, not to mention the dean's list at MI and top of your class at Quantico. You're asking me to join the Blue Rose task force. Yep. I'm in. I'll brief you in detail in the morning. Okay. [dramatic music] [glass thumps softly on table] [dial clicking] To Tammy and the Blue Rose. [exhales] The Blue Rose. The Blue Rose. [chuckles shakily] [glasses clink] [exhales] [chuckles] [cell phone chimes, buzzes] [Tammy exhales] Diane's on her way. [Tammy exhales] Have a seat, Diane. [Albert] Care for a drink? I like it on the rocks. [Albert] Well, you're in luck. The Dakotas are still in the Ice Age. [ice tinkling in glass] [liquid pouring] Diane, we know your work with Agent Cooper has given you more than a passing insight into the Blue Rose. Even though you're no longer a part of the bureau, we'd like to deputize you. [Gordon] On a temporary basis, because we really need your help. What's in it for me? [Albert] Some cash. Not much. Maybe the satisfaction of learning what happened to your friend Cooper. [dramatic music intensifying] Let's rock. [raps table] [birds chirping] Ah! [exhales sharply] [bell rings, scanner beeps] [sighs] Uh, could I have a carton of Salems, please? [scanner beeps] [bottles rattling] [scanner beeping] [bottles rattling, scanner beeps] [chuckles] How much is it? $133. 70. I don't remember seeing those beef jerky there before. Uh, that's new. [chuckles softly] What type is it? Uh, it's turkey, not beef. Is it smoked? Uh, I-I think so. It's the same as beef jerky, except it's made from turkey. [faint distorted music] Were you here when they first came? Uh, yes. They brought it in a couple weeks ago. Your room seems different. And men are coming. Uh, I'm I'm-I'm not sure I know what you mean. I am trying to tell you that you have to watch out! Things can happen! Something happened to me. Hmm? Something happened to me! [softly] I don't feel good. I don't feel good. I don't feel good. I don't feel good! Um Sarah. Sarah, s-stop doing this. Should-should I call a doctor? Stop doing this. Stop doing this. Okay. Leave this place. Find the car key. Find the car key. Get the car key. Get the car Get the goddamn car key! [boy whistles] What? I I know where she lives. I can d-deliver them. I guess. [leaves rustling] [passing engine hums] [door opens] [Carl] Kriscol. I want to ask you something. You been selling your blood again? Yes, sir. Now, Kriscol, did you install a new propane tank for Jenkins last week? Yes, sir. Did you get paid for that? No, sir. Do you mow lawns around here and rake up? Yes, sir. Do you get paid for that? No, sir. Okay, Kriscol. Here's 50 bucks for the work. Plus don't pay me for any rent this month. - What? - Rent is due soon. Don't pay it this month. And the next time you're thinking about selling your blood, come talk to me about it. I don't like it. I don't like people selling their blood to eat. It's true the hospital medical people need people to donate blood, but you've given enough already. Yes, sir. Keep your blood, Kriscol. Yes, sir. [thunder rumbling] [somber music] [knocking] [knocking] [fan whooshing] [knocking] [footsteps approaching] [sighs] Hello, Sarah. Hawk. Been meaning to stop by. Some old cases popped up, and I thought about you. That's very kind of you, but I suppose you're really here because of what happened in the grocery store. Yeah, I heard about that. Uh, people were worried about you. I just don't know what came over me. But, uh, you're okay now. I feel fine now. [bottles rattling faintly] - Is somebody in the house? - No. No, just something in the kitchen. You're okay, then. It's a goddamn bad story, isn't it, Hawk? Sarah, if you need any help, if you need anything, I want you to call, okay? I mean it. Help of any kind. Thanks, Hawk. [door shuts] [indistinct PA announcement] [door opens] [footsteps tapping] [door shuts] [monitor beeping] [rapid beeping] [cell phone buzzes] [door shuts] [smacks lips] [footsteps approaching] - [Beverly] Excuse me. - Hmm? Sheriff Truman is here. Yeah, please, have him come in. [murmuring] Oh. Frank. Good to see you. How are you? Have a seat. Yeah. So [clears throat] What can I do for you? There's no easy way to say this, Ben. Your grandson Richard was the one who ran over and killed that little boy. Oh, my God. Richard. And it looks like he tried to kill the only witness who saw him do it. Miriam Sullivan. Nursery school teacher. She's in intensive care. No insurance. Desperately needs an operation. - [sighs] - I was hoping that you could Of course. Of course. I'll take care of it. Richard. That boy has never been right. Sorry to have to bring you this news. [sighs] Harry, your brother, has had a number of run-ins with Richard. Nothing too bad, but each time was worse than the time before, and Does Harry know about this? Yeah. We stay in touch. And Richard is Where is he? Is he in jail? He's on the run. If you hear from him [laughs] Oh. I doubt that. We pretty much lost contact when I refused to give him more money. How's Harry? He's hanging in there. Course, we're hoping for the best. Of course. And that girl? Is she in the hospital here? Yeah. Intensive care? Yeah. And the boy's parents? As you can imagine. [groans] [sighs] [fingers tapping] [chuckles] I was going to send this to Harry. What's that? The key here. Showed up in the mail the other day. We haven't used a key like this in over 20 years. Room 315. I'm pretty sure that this is the key to Agent Cooper's old room. I thought Harry would like to have it as a memento. You think he would? Yeah. Yeah, Ben. You want me to take it for him? Yeah. Yeah. You think he would like it? Yeah. Interesting. We're just opening up an old case involving Agent Cooper. Strange this key shows up after all these years. Yeah. I thought so too. I really think he would like it. It'd mean a lot to him. Hmm. I'm sorry, Ben, to bring you this news. Good to see you again. Wish it was under better circumstances. [sighs] Yeah. I'll let you know if, uh if I hear from him. I'll let you know if we have more news. Thanks, Frank. For Harry. [door opens, shuts] Richard, my grandson, killed that little boy. I am so sorry. [exhales deeply] Richard never had a father. [chuckles] I remember I remember riding. My father got me this old Schwinn secondhand. He painted it green, got a new seat for it. Two-tone green, kind of a kind of a lime green and a deep forest green. Fat tires. Oh, it was so hard to ride, but I loved that bike. I loved that bike. I'd ride with my friends. Call the hospital. I want you to arrange to pay for all of Miriam, uh I don't even remember her last name, but they'll-they'll know who she is. All of Miriam's medical expenses. Richard assaulted her. She needs an operation. Beverly, please take care of this right away. Yeah, of course. I'll do it right now. [chuckles] I loved that bike. I loved that bike that my father got for me. The trap was set. They waited till after midnight, and then, 75 strong, they came up over the mountain, sirens wailing, guns drawn [knock at door] Albert. Gordon, would you please ask your friend to wait downstairs? Sweetheart, would you excuse us for a moment? I'll call you in the bar. Oui, Mon chéri. [giggles] [laughs] Très chic. [humming] [woman hums] [sniffs] [sighs] Très bon. It's a good one. Call you at the bar. She's here visiting a friend of her mother whose daughter has gone missing. The mother owns a turnip farm. I told her to tell the mother that her daughter will turn up eventually. She didn't get it either. Being French, it doesn't translate. Do you realize, Albert, that there are more than 6,000 languages spoken on Earth today? What is it, Albert? Incoming to Diane: Las Vegas? Outgoing: They haven't asked yet. What do we know that we haven't asked her about? We'll figure it out. But for now, I'd really like to get back to this fine Bordeaux. What kind is it? 11:05. Albert sometimes I really worry about you. [crickets chirping] [dull thumping] You sure? [Chantal] I'm sure. We don't have time for torture, babe. I'm hungry. Passed a Wendy's back there. Just shoot him. Okay, I'm there. I can shoot him in the legs. We kidnap him. Then you could torture him. Told you, I'm hungry. Just making sure. [Chantal] He's here. [gun clicking] [car door opens] [silenced gunshot] [gun clicking] [silenced gunshot] Daddy! Daddy. [dog barking] Next stop, Wendy's. [boy] Daddy! Daddy! [tires squealing] [boy] Daddy! Daddy! [alarm ringing] [bell tolls] It's seven o'clock. Do you know where your freedom is? [record player winding up] [Sousa's The Stars and Stripes Forever playing] Coming to you live and electrified from studio A, high atop the escarpments of White Tail Peak, the roof Ruff, ruff Of the American Hindu Kush, this is Dr. Amp doing the vamp for liberty, climbing the ramp to justice, and lighting the lamp of freedom. [switch clicks, fireworks exploding] So what's on your mind tonight? I mean, you know I'm gonna tell you what's on mine. We're sinking down deep in the mud. Act now! [key clicks] Friends, we all live in the mud. In the shit! Shovel your way out of the shit. [shimmering tones] [electricity buzzing] This is your shiny gold shovel. Two coats, guaranteed. Shovel your way out of the shit and into the truth. It's working for me, Dr. Amp. Dig yourself out of the shit $29. 99. That's right. Only $29. 99 plus shipping. Accept no substitute. Get yours now. [exhaling softly] Oh. [Dr. Amp] And the fucks are at it again! These giant multinational corporations are filled with monstrous vermin, poisonous, vile murderers, and they eat, drink, and shit money. They buy our politicians for a song. Then these fucking politicians sing as we gag and cough, sold down the river to die. Fuck you who betray the people you were elected to help, elected to work to help to make life better for. Fuck you all in the ass, you fucking treasonous puppets! The ninth level of hell will welcome you. [fire crackling] [exhales] Okay, I'm tired of waiting for the phone to ring. I'm going to the Roadhouse. I know he couldn't stand that place, but we've checked everywhere else. Are you coming with me? Audrey, look at this paperwork I have, and I've got a deadline. [scoffs] Look, stacks of it. How can I leave this and go out so late at night? I want to find Billy same as you, but can't we start out in the light of day? It's a new moon tonight. It'll be dark out there. Stay here and get a good sleep, and we'll both go looking tomorrow. What kind of shit are you? If you were missing, would you want people finishing their fucking homework before they went looking for you? [clears throat] You're nothing but a spineless, no-balls loser. Do you know that? - [exhales] - Do you? Because that's what you really are. Audrey, I have a deadline. - I have to do this. - [sighs] Why do you put me down for doing my allotted duty in life? Billy is out there somewhere, but you're not gonna find him tonight. I guarantee it. Oh, you know for certain. What fucking crystal ball are you looking into? Why don't you ask your crystal ball where the fuck Billy is, who's been missing for two days? Huh? Ask your ball. Come on, Audrey. You know I don't have a crystal ball. [laughs] It's already late, and I'm getting sleepy. I have so much more work to do before I get to sleep. You poor fucking thing. I told you, don't talk that way to your husband. I've been good to you. You always say it, how I've been good to you. Who cares? What? I got to thank you every hour on the hour, get on my knees and adore you? Audrey, I don't like the tone of your voice. Look, Charlie, let's just call a spade a spade. You have no balls. That's why I'm in love with Billy. That's why I am fucking Billy. Audrey. I saw Billy in my dream last night, and he was bleeding from the nose and mouth. And dreams sometimes hearken a truth. Now, I got to go, Charlie. I asked for your company, your protection, but you're such a milquetoast, the only protection would be me protecting you. And Tina I got to find Tina. She was the last person to see Billy, and I can't fucking stand being in the same room with her. You were supposed to call her, but you never did. Don't be sore at me, Audrey. You know I just want the best for you. Yeah? Well, then sign the papers I gave you. Uh, I don't know, Audrey. Those papers there's something fishy about them. I'm not signing anything until I run them by my lawyer. Oh, I see. Maybe I should run them by Paul. Maybe I should have Paul come give you a visit. Don't, Audrey. Don't be like this. I'm your lawfully wedded husband. I have rights. You gave up those rights. What? You mean you'd go back on our contract? Renege on a contract? That's what I will do. That's what I'm doing. Okay, Audrey. [clears throat] I'll go with you. I'm so sleepy, but I'll go. Where are we going? We're going to the Roadhouse. I told you. Oh, Audrey. [sighs] I'll go, then. I'll need my jacket. [sighs] I see you've already got yours. Uh, yeah, what the fuck do you think? I told you we were going out. Obviously I'll need my jacket. There's thousands of square miles of woods out there, Audrey. Do you think we're just gonna walk out the door or waltz into the Roadhouse and presto, there he'll be? Just get your jacket. Asshole. Wait a minute. Tina. Let me call her now, okay? I know, I'll tell her I'm alone, but let's see if she knows anything. If her husband's there, she won't be able to talk, but let's see. Okay? Okay, call the bitch. See what she knows. Supposedly she was the last one to see Billy, but I think Chuck is certifiable, so we can't count on shit from him. Chuck told you Tina was the last person to see Billy? Yeah. Did you know that Chuck stole Billy's truck last week? What are you talking about? Billy came out of his house and saw Chuck driving off with his truck. And? And Billy called the sheriff. And? And they found the truck that same afternoon. So what happened, then? They called Billy, and I guess Billy got his truck back and dropped any charges. Really? Okay. [stammers] Call Tina. [rotary dial clicking] [exhales] [exhales deeply] [line trilling] I'm so tired, Audrey. [line continues trilling] Hello? Yes, Tina. It's Charlie. How are you? [sighs] Yeah? Yeah, I know. Sorry to call so late. I wanted to ask you something. Okay? Yeah, so Chuck told me you might have been the last person to see Billy. Is this true? [mouthing words] What? Yeah, I know that. [mouthing words] You're sure? But Okay. Yeah. Yes, Tina. Okay. How did you find What? Really? Oh, my goodness. Thank you, Tina. Great. I'll talk to you soon. I'll try tomorrow. [sighs] Yeah, again, sorry to call so late. Unbelievable, what you're telling me. I won't. Come [scoffs] I promise. Yeah, me too. Bye. [dial tone droning] You're not gonna tell me what she said? [exhales sharply] [yelling] You're not gonna tell me what she said? Charlie! [vacuum whirring] I know you're closed. Thanks. [whispering] Coordinates. Co or din ates plus two. [ambient whooshing] [electricity buzzing] [soft rock music playing] [mouthing words] [bottles clink] Where's Angela? I haven't got a clue. She was supposed to show last night. She didn't show then either. She might be with Clark. Clark? Yeah. They've been hanging out lately. Really? Yeah. You look surprised. Yeah, 'cause I saw Clark and Mary together here, like, two nights ago. I hate her. Well And Angela fucking really hates her too. What were they doing? Like, practically making out. Slow dancing and getting real close. Over in the corner. Off in their own world. Lots of people saw 'em. Angela's gonna go crazy when she gets wind of this. She's getting really serious about Clark. He's been on her for a couple of weeks now. She's even dreaming about the guy. Shit. I guess Clark's spreading it around. And she's off her meds now. [sighs] I hope Clark doesn't fuck this up. She won't be able to take it, I don't think. Well, yeah. She's kind of on the edge. Who wouldn't be? Losing her mom like that? Fuck. - [Natalie] Yeah. - [Trick] Hey! I almost got fucking killed coming over here. Some fucking ass-eater's heading toward me on the highway and runs me off the road. All I see is two headlights coming fucking right at me. I drove off the road and almost hit a tree. Some farmer had to pull me out. Man, I could kill the motherfucker that did that. I need a beer. Obviously you want one too. - Do you want another one? - [Abbie] Yeah, sure. All right, I'll be right back. [Abbie] Thanks, Trick. Trick's lucky to be alive, sounds like. Sure does. By the way, isn't Trick under house arrest? No. I-I mean, yeah, but he got that behind him now. He's a free man again. [laughs] A free man. Whoopee. [electricity crackling]"

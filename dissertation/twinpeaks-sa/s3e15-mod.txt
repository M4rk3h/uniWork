"15","[electricity crackling] [atmospheric music] [birds calling] [gas station bell dinging] [electric tools clanking] [engine turns over] [Nadine] Ed! Nadine? Ed, I've come to tell you something. Honey, where's your car? How'd you get here? - I walked. - You walked? What's with the shovel? That's what I want to talk to you about. - It is? - Yes. Ed, I've come to tell you I've changed. You have? Yes, and Ed, you know I love you so much I know you do, Nadine. But I've been a selfish bitch to you all these years, and you've been a saint. What? Listen to me. I've known since forever you love Norma and she loves you. I kept the two of you apart because of my jealousy. And I manipulated you, Ed. No, no, you haven't, Nadine. Oh, no, you know it's true. I guilted you to stay, and you're so good you stayed and gave up your love. Oh, God, Ed, I want you to be free. [sighs softly] I'm fine now. You asked about this shovel. Well, I'm shoveling myself out of the shit. Have you been watching that show of Jacoby's? You know I have. Nadine Don't worry about me. Run to her. [gasps] Enjoy the rest of your lives together. I am so happy just thinking of you two being happy. Ed, I love you and always will, but true love is giving the other what makes them happy. Jeez, you big lug, how beautiful is this! Nadine, I want you to think real hard about what you're saying because you're not making any sense. Honey, tomorrow, you're gonna wish you never said these things. Ed, I told you, I walked all the way here. I had plenty of time to think, turn back, but I didn't because this is how I really feel. And you can thank Dr. Amp, our old friend, Dr. Jacoby. To me, he's about the only one around here telling it like it is. So, the gist of it is: Ed, you are free. Go and enjoy. [soft exhalations] Oh.

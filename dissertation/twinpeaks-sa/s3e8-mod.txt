Thanks for getting me out of there. How'd you do this? Darya told me what happened. You needed to get out, Ray. Where's Darya? She's waiting for a phone call when we get someplace safe. Where are we going? You'd probably like to go to that place they call The Farm. That's what I was thinking. We're heading in the right direction. I Just saying. They're not gonna let us just walk. Are they? They're bound to be looking for us soon. You have something I want, Ray. Yes, I do. [brooding atmospheric music] I got it memorized. All the numbers, memorized perfectly. But honestly, Mr. Cooper, I think it might be worth some money. Maybe quite a lot of money. You think so, do you? Yes, sir, I do. There it is. Take that little road up there on the right.

And I told him where I'm going, so if he comes after me, I'll get him there. [phone beeps] [discordant instrumentation] Ladies and gentlemen, the Roadhouse is proud to welcome the Nine Inch Nails.

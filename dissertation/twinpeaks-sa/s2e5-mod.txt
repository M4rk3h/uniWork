"5","Diane  it's 6:42 a.m. Rough sleep. I had dreamt I was eating a large  tasteless gumdrop. I awoke to realise I was aggressively munching on one of my Air-Pillow silicone earplugs. Hence the tastelessness. Perhaps I should keep a closer eye on my after-dinner coffee consumption. Persistent soreness in the rib area  which I'm treating each morning with After which  thankfully  the pain retreats to a cul-de-sac in a distant suburb of my conscious mind. I'm going to begin today with a headstand. Diane  I am now upside down. Mind becoming porous. The day's tasks coming into focus. Objects growing clearer. Diane  the Giant was right. I did forget something. Hey. Thought we'd lost you to the Kalispell woods. Two retired female schoolteachers live in that house next to the Palmers. They have no memory of a grey-haired man. I had to drink three pots of chamomile tea to find that out. Which reminds me. Would you excuse me for a minute? - Sure. - Thanks. Keep looking for the one-armed man. We gotta find him. Excuse me  sheriff  I just wanted to say goodbye because  as you know  I'm going down to Tacoma for two days to visit my sister Gwen and her husband  Larry  who had a baby last week. - Right. - That is  Gwen had the baby. Larry's the father. You remember? It was a boy. Well  anyway  as soon as the Can-Do temp girl gets here  I'll explain the phones and the coffee and the intercom-- - Lucy  it's okay. - And the wag-- We got it covered. No  she should've been here by now. - I can stay and at least show her-- - Lucy  don't worry. Just go. Sometimes the Can-Do girls can't. - But  sheriff-- - We got it covered. Have a safe trip  Lucy. Thank you. - Morning  Coop. - Harry. What is the word on our delivery tonight? We won't need it. We've got the jump on them. I know where Audrey is. You see  the Port-O-Patient will allow you to fluently transport the unfortunate Mr. Johnson  allowing him to even go outside  and sit and experience what he can of nature. Mr. Pinkle  I want my cousin Leo to have the fullest possible experience of life. Well  that's what we're here for. Okay  let's give it one more. Mr. Pinkle  are you gonna install the ramp? Well  sure  of course  of course. As a matter of fact  I already have some-- Some plywood ramp-- Pinewood ramp boards that I'll install tomorrow. Absolutely. That's a very good suggestion. Now  I think we are ready to go. Finally. Here we go. All right? That's a new wrinkle. I can't believe it. It was working just so perfectly yesterday. Come on. Come on-- You gotta be tough with this thing. You gotta hit it hard. A machine is like a woman  we always say at the machine shop. Come on. Oh  Bobby  are you okay? Shelly  could you get Mr. Pinkle a cold drink  please? A diet soda  please. That would be great. Pinkle  Pinkle  Pinkle. This thing is a death trap. I told you we have to keep him alive. The insurance companies don't exactly pay off like the slots. After we take our cuts  we had only money for this or a first-rate wheelbarrow. Oh  thank you very much. Oh  thanks a lot. Bobby? - I've gotta meet Leo's lawyer. - The hearing's today  right? Be just another second  folks. Bobby are we okay? Oh  that's it. Come and take a look. You can see it. It works just fine. Come outside with me. He can let himself out. Bobby  we're doing real good. Okay  that's enough. Bobby? Bob  Bob  I can't reach the switch. Bobby  I've got a problem here. Mr. Palmer has pleaded not guilty to the charge of murder in the first degree. The defence has requested bail. This pre-trial hearing is to determine whether that bail will be granted. Mr. Prosecutor. We  the people of the State of Washington  move the defendant be denied bail. On the basis of one  the great seriousness of the crime for which he has been accused. Two  the apparently premeditated nature of this act. And three  the oft-witnessed instability of Mr. Palmer during the period following the death of his daughter. Sheriff Truman will speak for the defence. Your Honour  Leland Palmer is a well-known  well-liked  well-respected member of this community. His roots go way back. His grandfather  Joshua Palmer  brought the family here more than 75 years ago. Your Honour  no one can know what it's like to lose a daughter the way Leland did. That's all. Thank you  sheriff. Mr. Lodwick  would you care? I thought I might sell this to the Gazette. They seem to like courtroom sketches. Yeah  why don't you try for a little more face than that? --High standing community  and the pristine nature of his public Just an idea. Good. Thanks  sheriff. The defendant is released on his own recognisance. Now  Leland  as you know  I will require you to remain in town and making your whereabouts known to the sheriff on a regular basis. Sid  check the calendar  and we'll set a date for Mr. Palmer's trial as soon as possible. - Hi. - Hi. Thank you. So  what's behind those deep blue eyes today? I've got a proposition for you. I'll share my life with you. I'll tell it to you. Part of your living novel if you let me read Laura's diary. That's intriguing. I'll read it to you. But it mustn't physically leave this room. Acceptable. - You'll start? - Of course. A bargain has been struck. Donna Hayward. - Begin. - All right. I'm from Twin Peaks. Actually  I was born here. My father delivered me. He's a doctor. Where are you from? I grew up in Boston. Well  actually  I grew up in books. There's things you can't get in books. There are things you can't get anywhere. But we dream they can be found in other people. Continue. Maybe our dreams are real. My turn. What are you doing? Maybe I'll read it out here on the lawn. Please. We've only just started. Why don't you come with me. Come on. What's there to be afraid of? Come on. Please? Give that back to me. Harold? Harold? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. The defence will continue with its evidence. If you would  Mr. Racine. You can see from these EEGs  this chart here  which is actually of my own head  is intended to show normal brain activity. Objection to the use of the word ""normal "" Your Honour. Well  he's close enough. Objection overruled. This chart here is of Mr. Johnson and shows minimal activity. A previously submitted medical report states that Mr. Johnson has suffered diffuse brain damage. He doesn't currently even have the perspicacity to take the standard CST competency test. We therefore submit that trying this individual would constitute a mockery of the justice system. A proceeding that the unfortunate young man would not even faintly comprehend. Mr. Prosecutor. I know Leo Johnson isn't in very good shape. On the surface  it might seem ridiculous to make him stand trial. But the trial does more than just punish the wrongdoer. It also brings a feeling of justice and retribution to a community. Among the various crimes Leo Johnson is suspected of  the murder of Laura Palmer is the sort that can wound an entire town. As long as Leo Johnson carries a breath  - All right. - He is as eminently deserving of a trial as this community is of a sense of resolution! All right. Now  have a seat  Mr. Lodwick. Now  you fellas can catch your breath. I am going to need to deliberate. Mr. Cooper  Sheriff Truman  if I could have the pleasure of your company. Sid  can you fix us up with three black yukon sucker punches? Yes  Your Honour. Lodwick really planted his feet and looked it in the eye. I didn't expect him to press on the murder charge. Cooper  is Leo Johnson our man? No  sir. I don't believe he is. Harry  what's the temperature of the town? Do they want a trial or a lynching? They want the right man brought to justice. Well  they don't need a circus. And this poor bastard  he seems to be a heady cabbage. Thoughts  Cooper? I feel the killer will eventually be apprehended. You have to watch these. They sneak up on you. I'm gonna declare Leo Johnson to be not competent to stand trial. And when medically possible  that he be shipped home. Harry  do you wanna tell the little lady yourself? Thanks  Clinton. - Cooper  how long you been here? - Twelve days  sir. - They're not gonna try him. - No? Leo is coming home. I'll advise you to keep your eye on the woods. The woods are wondrous here but strange. Thanks. Can I get you anything  Nadine? - Who are you? - Who am I? - You go to the high school. - Well  yeah. Yeah  it took me a second. You're not in any of my classes. Why don't you sit down  honey. Let me get you a drink. Oh  no  I'll get it. Where are Mom and Dad? Oh  out of town. Okay. Doc Hayward said to roll with the punches. Have you thought about maybe taking her to see Dr. Jacoby? No  he's in Hawaii recovering from that heart attack. It just came right off. - Mr. Tojamura is here. - Mister who? Excuse me. - Do you have an appointment  Mr? - Tojamura. I represent Asian investment bank. We have superior offer for Ghostwood Project. I have commitment letters from Tokyo banks prepared to move immediately. This all sounds very interesting  but unfortunately  I have an important conference call in a couple of minutes. I have prospectus - Perhaps some other time. - and taste. Five. Million? I would like you to leave these. Let my people have a look at them. Point of visit. Arigato  Tojamura san. Cooper's on his way. Your call from Canada  Mr. Horne. - Is that our call? - Yes. You pushed it pretty close. - Benjamin Horne. - Are you ready to play? Audrey. - I wanna talk to my daughter. - That can wait for tonight. One time. Across the border  five miles east of Grand Forks  on the road to Castlegar  is a bar called the Colombian. Behind it is a failed amusement park. Go to the merry-go-round. Leave the briefcase beside the horse with no head  at midnight  alone. I'll be sending my representative. Serialised denominations  as you instructed. My daughter's life is in your hands. Stay by a phone. Follow him. Make sure that he and the money are neatly delivered. - Bring Audrey back. - Cooper's not bringing her back? Cooper isn't coming back. If you can manage it  bring back Audrey and the briefcase. Five million dollars. Now  that's a good day's work. All right  once you're in Harold's apartment  move as fast as you can. This is scary. Laura's diary is in a secret shelf at the very bottom of the bookcase  behind a row of fake books. Now  I think that there's a doohickey on the right-hand side that somehow lets the shelf slide out and down. All the notebooks look the same  except for Laura's. Hers is smaller with a red cover. How are you gonna get him to go outside? Not outside  just out of the front room. Then I'll signal you with the flashlight through the window. The door will be open. I thought you liked this guy. I do. Okay. Cooper hands me the briefcase. I take it What about Ben Horne? Well  he give up control of One-Eyed Jack's. It's yours. With his daughter dead? You know  you love a good steak but you don't want to know how it got on your plate. You must be serious about your business  Blackie. How are you gonna do the girl? Voil�. - Does the girl sleep? - Dreamland. Come  come  come. Come to me. In the other room  the girl dreams of fishes and dark lakebeds and tangle weeds. What about Blackie? - I've waited long enough. - We have our fun tonight. Kiss me. Right. Okay. Bye. - Laboratory Services. - Yeah  I'm calling for some test results. Doc Hayward said I could just call you up-- - Yes  what test was it for  sir? - What's it for? Yes  please  sir. It was for a semens analysis. Brennan  Andy. - I'm sorry  I can't hear you  sir. - Sorry. Brennan  Andy. Oh  the doctor's analysis is oligospermia  sir. Yes  could you go slower. I wanna write all this down. - Oligospermia. - ""Oligospermia. "" - That's right. - That sounds terrible. - I have that? - No  sir. You had that. Oh  I had it. - Too few sperms. - ""Too few sperms. "" Very good  sir. You mean I'm cured? The doctor says they're not just three men on a-- ""Doc says they're not just three men on a fishing trip  - They're a whole damn town. - They're a whole damn town. "" - That's right  sir. Do you understand? - Yeah  I know what it means. It means they're not really real people  they're-- - I'm sorry  sir  I've got another call. - Oh  okay. Thank you. - You're welcome  sir. - Thank you very much. I'm a whole damn town! I'm a whole damn town. Don't ask. Where were we? Okay  main bar and greeting room here. Casino and get-acquainted room. - What's this  Blackie's office? - We'll find out when we get there. The one-armed man is staying in the Robin's Nest Motel on Highway 9. Nobody's seen him for at least a day  a day and a half. The room looks lived in. I found this. Same drug as last time. A weird  deep smell. We're still waiting on Albert's analysis. Good work  Hawk. Hawk  see you in the morning. Okay. We'll approach through the woods to the rear door. Inside are stairs leading down to the working rooms. My guess is  that's where Audrey's being held. What kind of muscle do they have? A couple of floor men in the casino  probably more in the back. Let's go get her. - Good night  Andy. - See you in the morning  Andy. Good work. ""Gwen and Larry. "" - Adam's Abortion Clinic. - Hi  is Lucy--? What? Adam's Abortion Clinic. Oh  my God. Can I get a cup of coffee to go? - Hi. - Hi. Large  please. - So you seen Donna today? - No  sorry. - You? - No. - So  what's with the coffee? - Coffee? It's for Uncle Leland. You don't have coffee at home? James  I can't talk now. - I need to go. - You need to go? - Where you going? - Home. Bye  James. Donna Hayward. March 7th  Tuesday. Second session. Dear diary This is from a long time ago. Is that okay? I was about 13 years old  14 maybe. Me and Laura put on our tightest  shortest skirts. Too tight. But Laura talked me into it. We were going to the Roadhouse to meet boys. Their names are Josh  Rick and Tim. They're about 20 years old. And they're nice to us. And they make us feel like we're older. Rick asks if we wanna go party. And Laura says  yes. And all of a sudden  I feel this knot building up in my stomach. But when Laura gets in the truck with Rick  I go anyway. Stream in the woods. Full moon  I think. It's pale and light out. Laura starts to dance around the boys. She begins to move her hips back and forth. Rick starts to clap  but Tim doesn't do anything  he just watches. Somehow  that makes me angry. So I say  ""Let's go skinny-dipping. "" We take off our clothes. I know the boys are watching. Laura starts to kiss Josh and Rick. I don't know what to do. So I swim away. I feel like I wanna run  but I don't. Tim swims out to me. He kisses my hand and then me. I can still feel that kiss. His lips are warm and sweet. My heart jumps. He's talking to me  but I can't hear him. Only the kiss. I never saw him again. It was the first time I ever fell in love. That's all. That was beautiful  Donna. I got him. Harry. Wait here  Harry. No. Dead end. - Two. - Audrey? Not such a bad way to go  all things considered. No  no. It's beautiful. - Is she alone? - Nancy's with her. What does she do for you I can't? Well  something new. Most people imagine orchids growing in exotic  steamy places. But you can grow them anywhere. It's all basically a matter of water and light  isn't it? It's beautiful. Here  look. See  humidity is paramount. Well  the control of it  I mean. Too much moisture is an invitation to disease. Three sepals and three petals. The bottom petal  shaped like a lower lip  is called a labellum. So delicate. Well  it's the landing platform  really  for pollinating insects. Romantic  isn't it? Will you excuse me a minute? Hi. Would you take me to Audrey Horne  please? - I don't think she's available. - Let's double-check. It's not my idea  okay? You're nothing but meat on a hook to these people. Shut up. Audrey  can you hear me? My prayers. Audrey  I'm gonna take you out of here now. No. When you leave me with a kiss. That's the way you want it  that's fine. Drop the gun. Slowly. Now  turn around. Good thing you guys can't keep a secret. Good throw. There's been gunfire. Truman and Cooper are leaving with your daughter. Now  who can this be? Monsieur Lodwick. DA's office  eh? - Is something wrong? - No. You just frightened me  that's all. Come here. Tell me about this orchid. This one. Harold  no  you don't understand. Maddy! Wait! Are you looking for secrets? Is that what all this is about? Well  maybe I can help you. Do you know what the ultimate secret is? You want to know? Laura did. The secret of knowing who killed you."

"14","Good Lord. Andy  I want this dusted for prints. No one saw a thing. The blackout and the fire drew everyone out of the building. - How long has he been dead? - It's hard to say. We'll need an autopsy. Doc  if you lift up the victim's shirt  I believe you'll find a stab wound  one inch beneath the sternum  penetrating upwards  severing the aorta. You've seen this before. - Yeah. - Any traces? No blood stains. What's this? - Douglas fir  Harry? - Lodgepole pine. Hawk  footprints? Two sets  same boots  one coming  one leaving. Heavier impressions on the way down. Carrying the body. Coop  are you sure Windom Earle's behind this? A short time ago  a vagrant  our victim  was befriended and offered a lift. He was driven to a location up beyond the ridge. The car will still be there. He was stabbed once. He managed to run a short distance before collapsing. Windom Earle engineered the explosion that caused the power outage. He created a diversionary fire that drew everyone out of the station. Brought the body in through this window. Windom Earle has been in this room. I can still feel his presence. Harry  we're not gonna find any fingerprints in here. No mistakes. No slip-ups. Everything has its own rationale  precision  intelligence. Windom Earle is a genius. And he's taken his first pawn in a very sick game. Listen carefully  Bobby Briggs. This is what we're gonna do. If there's one thing I learned from my father before he flipped his wig  it's that a business relationship is like a sacred pact. Equaled only by the closest of personal relationships  where nothing is held back. Right. Do you wanna get rich  Bobby? - Immediately. - Well  maybe I can help. Let's pretend that this is my father. - An ice cube? - Right. And our job now is to help my father come back from limbo land before he melts away and leaves us with a handful of nothing. We wouldn't want that to happen  would we? No. So from now on  Bobby  I'm the one you suck up to. - What about Shelly? - What about Shelly? Leo. Leo? Leo? No. No. Help me! Please! Help me! No! No! Leo? Please. Bad girl. Please  please don't. No! I swear. I'll kill you. Help me! Help! Shelly? Shelly. Shelly  come on. No. No! - No! - Shelly? No  no  Leo. Shelly! - Shelly! - No  please. - No! - Leo  you bastard! Goodbye  wife. Shelly. Leo! Goodbye. Bobby! Bobby. Everything's okay  baby. He's gone. - Here. - Thanks  Harry. Well  no fibers  no prints. You were right. If it is Earle  he didn't miss a beat. Did you hear anything from Denise? The Bureau and the DEA cleared me of all criminal charges. The suspension still stands. I'm waiting to hear from Gordon. In the meantime  you're still my deputy. If you want this case  it's yours. Harry  I want it. Harry. I found that car on the logging road just like you said. No prints. And just so you know  Hank Jennings didn't make the buy at Dead Dog because he was in the hospital. Claims he was hit by a bus. I cuffed him to the bed and booked him for parole violations. Shelly Johnson called. She said Leo came to last night  attacked her and ran off into the woods. Holy smokes. Lucy  we need to talk. It's about Nicky. Little Nicky? Dick and I have been doing some thinking and some looking  and we think he's a-- He's a-- A what? We think he murdered his parents. - He's 9 years old. - I know. We think he was 6 at the time of the crime. I met little Nicky. I've talked to little Nicky. If you two think for one second that I'll believe that a defenseless little orphan is capable of murder  the both of you aren't fit to be fathers to a chimp. I'm gonna get to the bottom of this right away. Hello  you must be James. I'm Jeffrey Marsh. I've been hearing very good things about your work from Evelyn. Well  you'll see how it is when you take it out. I'm sure it will be fine. It's lucky we found you. No  my luck. I hear you were on the road. Yeah  I will be soon. No itinerary  no deadlines. I'm envious. Wish I was going with you. Maybe after I take her for a spin  we'll talk shop. Sounds like we have a mutual love: Cars. Yeah  well  actually I'm kind of overdue as it is. Of course he'll stay. There are plenty of things I could find for him to do. Right  James? Yeah. Yeah  maybe. Excuse me. - Nice kid. - He's done a fine job on the car. Let's see what it will do on the open road. Goodbye  Jeffrey. Doc  it's Nadine I wanna talk about. Nadine wants to start dating boys and I don't know what to say. Is she sexually active? Active? Doc  I wake up every morning feeling like I've been hit by a timber truck. It's the extra adrenaline. Well  it's downright dangerous. She's liable to kill a young kid. I don't know what to say. Be patient. And tell her to be home by 9:00 on school nights. Extra potatoes. Well  thanks. Ed  Donna took the van this morning. Said something about looking for James. Is there anything I need to worry about? Well  James is out west a couple of hours. Trying to clear his head  I think. Donna's taking him some money. Not easy being a parent  is it? Boy  I'll say. Well - See you  Ed. - Thanks  doc. Hank's in the hospital. He said a tree fell on him. Honey  that tree was a redwood called Nadine. Yesterday after you left  Hank jumped me. Right in my own living room. If Nadine hadn't shown up Nadine took out Hank? And it wasn't pretty. Harry called. He said he'll be arresting Hank for parole violation. When Hank gets well  he may have to go back to prison. I think it's time I start correcting a few of the mistakes I've made. Well  we could start by getting a cabin. A couple of venison steaks and a bottle of sparkling wine. People will find out. Let them. - Don't you knock? - I'm sorry. - Are you leaving? - Yeah. You were good with Jeffrey. It didn't feel that good. I can change that. It's wrong. Love isn't wrong  James. Please don't leave me. Don't leave me alone with him. What a shot! I'm gonna go check my bike. So how does chess figure into all this? Because Windom Earle and I played a game every day for three years. He felt that all of life could be found in the patterns and conflicts on the board. Because I never beat him. Now it's my turn. I'll publish my response in the Twin Peaks Gazette. I don't know what else to do. Coop  you're gonna have to give me some more information here. Harry  I've brought some baggage to town I haven't told you about. Windom Earle was my first partner. Everything I know about the law and the Bureau  I owe to him. Four years ago  we drew the assignment of protecting a material witness in a federal crime. She was a very beautiful  very gentle woman. Her name was Caroline. She and I fell in love. One night  I failed in my vigilance. An attack was made. I wasn't ready. I was wounded and I lost consciousness. When I came to  she was in my arms. She was dead. She'd been stabbed. The wounds on the vagrant? Identical. The killer was never found. My wound healed  Windom Earle went mad. Institutionalized until his recent escape. So why is he after you? Harry  Caroline was Windom Earle's wife. So he blames you for her death. It's much worse than that. I think he killed her. And I think he committed the crime that she originally witnessed. Harry  Windom Earle's mind is like a diamond. It's cold and hard and brilliant. I think he feigned the insanity that sent him away. But at some point  he lost the ability to distinguish between what's right and what's wrong. You don't know what he's capable of  Harry. You don't know. Coffee  please. I'm looking for a biker named James. You look like someone in need of help. I'm looking for someone. What's his name? James. James Hurley? Yeah. You know him? He did some work for me recently. What kind of work? He fixed my husband's car. Where is he? He left. Yesterday  on his bike. Where did he go? He said something about the ocean. Mexico  I think. That's all? Are you what he's running away from? Look  dear  why don't you go home? He'll be back. Coffee's on me. He's marching on Washington. We think he's getting close. - Ben? - He prefers general. General. Jeb. He thinks you're General Jeb Stuart. You're in the cavalry. Jeb  there is a great day upon us. By dawn  our troops will be on the outskirts of Washington. By midday  it will fall. And we will once again walk on our cherished fields at home. Only God can stop us now. And it is my firm belief  Jeb  that the Almighty is a Southerner. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You really think it's a good idea for Ben to be carrying this sword? Well  he thinks he's on a forced march to Washington. You know  he's crossing the Maryland border as we speak. What he's doing is quite healthy. I mean  by reversing the South's defeat in the Civil War  he  in turn  will reverse his own emotional setback. What he needs right now is both your understanding and a Confederate victory. Men of the South  from this day to the ending of the earth  we who fight shall be remembered. For our bravery  for the battle scars that we bear. We few We happy few. We band of brothers  onwards to Washington. Oh  I wish I was In the land of cotton Old time there I've not forgotten Look away  look away Look away  Dixie land I wish I was in Dixie Hooray  hooray In Dixie land I'll take my stand And live or die in Dixie Major Briggs? I need to see the sheriff. Major Briggs. More? - I'm fine. - Fine  Lucy. Fine. Major  what happened? Well  as men who have dedicated their lives to service  I know that you're able to understand how sacred I hold the Pledge of Allegiance. And the cost one must pay when breaking a pledge. It can be very great. Well  the Air Force  I thought  was not unlike other societies of men dedicated to the fight for the good. Gentlemen  frankly  I'm worried. When my superiors questioned me about my disappearance  they exhibited a degree of suspicion and intolerance bordering on the paranoid. I must now admit that their motivation in the search for the White Lodge is not ideologically pure. I believe that during my disappearance  I was taken to the White Lodge. I can remember virtually nothing. But I have the clear intuitive sense that there is much trouble ahead. Major  what kind of trouble? I am not aware of the form it will take. I will return. Until that time  I will be in the shadows if you need me. - Good day  gentlemen. - Good day  major. - In the shadows. Can you beat that? - Nope. Excuse me  sheriff  Agent Cooper  may I show you something? Good. I wanted all of you to hear this. I've just spent almost the last 24 hours with this charming young lady. And as you can see  I have no bruises  no broken bones. Any claims by her deceased husband's brother that she is cursed or somehow responsible for his death is nonsense. Now  what she does  in fact  possess is a heightened sexual drive and a working knowledge of technique  anatomy and touch that few men have ever had the pleasure of experiencing or the skill to match. Is it hot in here? - Yeah. - Yeah. Lana  let me be the first to congratulate you. Thank you. Well  I could never have done it without Dr. Jacoby. Okay. Well  then  we're gonna go bowling. See you later  guys. Don't anybody move. Mr. Mayor. Put the gun down. Anybody that moves  I'll blast her into kingdom come. And the hippie too. Dwayne. Dwayne  this isn't gonna solve anything. - She killed my brother. - Mr. Mayor  she killed no one. - Horse dung. - Fellas  I've got an idea. Why don't we let Lana and the mayor talk things over together? Alone. I don't wanna talk. I wanna shoot. Now  Dwayne  you can always shoot later. Talk first. Come on  in here. Lana  it's okay. Mr. Mayor  please. Mr. Mayor  please. - Now what? - We wait. - We wait. - We wait. It's hard waiting. Okay. Ready  men? Let's go. We've decided to adopt a child. He's so much like Dougie. I just feel like my husband's been brought back to life. Well  I've been Ionely and selfish. I hope you'll all forgive me for my boorish behavior. Come along  my dear. I don't know about you guys  but I could definitely use something to drink. Me too. Hot dogs. - We forgot the hot dogs. - Pete. We forgot the wienies. All beef  with the skin on them. - Has Josie gone shopping yet? - Yes  she's already gone. Well  if you think you can tear yourself away from all this high-level executive decision-making for a moment  I have something I'd like to show you. Have you ever asked yourself how I really survived after the fire? How I was able to marshal the resources necessary to defeat Benjamin Horne and win back the mill? Now that you mention it  yeah. Come here. Pete Martell. Andrew? I saw the boat. - You-- - Take all the time you need. Good old Pete. As you can surmise  I had my brother Andrew's help. Now  let me get this straight. You didn't die in the boat accident. We didn't tell you  Pete-- With apologies much delayed. --Because you didn't need to know. Okay. Fine. We discovered the attempt on my life was coming  so we arranged this little deception. Who tried to push the button on you  Andy? Does the name Thomas Eckhardt mean anything to you? No. Eckhardt and I were business partners. I knew lumber  he knew Hong Kong. We made a lot of money  had some fun. Then I got the better of him in a piece of business  and he tried to stab me in the back. Really? He's a very dangerous and powerful opponent. Eckhardt planned Andrew's death for six years. Does Josie know you're alive  Andy? Pete  dear  Josie worked for Thomas Eckhardt. Oh  my God. Does she still? We'll know when Eckhardt arrives. He's coming here? I've never known Josie's seductive powers to fail. He'll come for her  like a rat for cheese. Good evening. How may I help you? I have two suites reserved. - Name? - Eckhardt. Thomas Eckhardt. Welcome to Twin Peaks. Andy  in here. We're gonna talk. Andy? Andy? Cooper. I need to ask you a favor. Harry  let's get one thing straight. I work for you now. You say drink coffee  I'll drink coffee. This just came over the wire from Seattle. Josie told me she got away from him. Think Josie had something to do with this? I don't know. I don't know. That's why I need you to find out. Okay  Harry. When Lucy told me about your theory  I called the orphanage and cut through the red tape. Nicky is no more a murderer than Lucy or I. I believe ""pathological"" was the phrase-- Dick  I did not drop you on your head when I brought you into this world. Don't give me cause to regret that. - Doc  it's just that-- - Shut up  the both of you  and listen. Nicky entered this world through the back door  where hope and promise never see the light. His mother was a poor immigrant chambermaid at the Great Northern. Nicky was conceived during an assault in a back alley by a man who fled across the border. She never reported it to the police but when she began to show  she reported it to me. But Nicky's mother had a dream of a better life for herself and her child. A dream that she brought with her to this country. She decided to carry that child. But the poor wretch never saw the boy. She died just as Nicky took his first breath. We buried her in potter's field and sent the infant to the orphanage. For several years  Nicky was shuttled from one state home to another. And then one day  hope shined on little Nicky. A young  childless couple took him into their lives. They were loving  caring parents. But it all collapsed one terrible moment on an icy highway. There was a crash. Six-year-old Nicky managed to pull his parents from the blazing car  but it was too late. And Nicky was alone again  as he is today. I hope you two are happy. - James  what are you doing? - What does it look like I'm doing? Are you leaving? Are you leaving? I can't stay here. - I don't understand. - It's wrong! - Because I'm married? - Yes. Yes. I love you  James. I've never said that to anybody before in my life. I love you. There's been an accident. Jeffrey is dead. - His car? - Yes. You killed him. No. No. No. My God! You set me up! It was Malcolm's idea. He's not my brother. Hurry  James. Go find that young girl who loves you. Go. James? Donna? Donna. We gotta hurry. Come on. Come on. Where is Shelly? Bad girl. No  no. Come in. It's all right. I'm a friend. Come in. You look like you've had a very hard night. Come. Sit. I will help you. What's your name? - Leo. - Leo? Well  Leo. You can call me Windom. Windom Earle."

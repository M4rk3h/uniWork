"17","[ELECTRICITY CRACKLING] [ATMOSPHERIC MUSIC] [JULEE CRUISE'S FALLING PLAYING] [DISTANT BIRDS CALLING] [LIQUID POURING] You okay, Gordon? I couldn't do it, Albert. I couldn't do it. You've gone soft in your old age. What? I said, You've gone soft in your old age. Not where it counts, buddy. Here's to the Bureau. - To the Bureau. - To the Bureau. Now listen to me. For 25 years, I've kept something from you, Albert. Before he disappeared, Major Briggs shared with me and Cooper his discovery of an entity, an extreme negative force called in olden times Jowday. Over time, it's become Judy. Major Briggs, Cooper, and I put together a plan that could lead us to Judy. And then something happened to Major Briggs, and something happened to Cooper. Phillip Jeffries, who doesn't really exist anymore, at least not in the normal sense, told me a long time ago he was onto this entity, and he disappeared. Now, the last thing Cooper told me was If I disappear like the others, do everything you can to find me. I'm trying to kill two birds with one stone. And now this thing of two Coopers. And recently, a paid informant named Ray Monroe sent a cryptic message indicating that the Cooper we met at prison is looking for coordinates, coordinates from a certain Major Briggs. This plan, Albert, I couldn't tell you about, and I'm sorry. I understand. I know you understand, Albert, yet I'm still sorry. And I don't know at all if this plan is unfolding properly 'cause we should have heard by now from our dear Dale Cooper. [TELEPHONE RINGS] [BEEPS] This is Cole. [HEADLEY] Agent Headley here, sir. We found him. We found Douglas Jones. [HEADLEY] But we don't know where he is. Has my watch stopped, or is that one of the Marx Brothers? What the hell does that mean, Headley? The bed is empty. My team is sending everything to you as we speak. [HEADLEY] Director Cole, we got it all the whole story. Is that Gordon Cole on the phone? Yes, it is. - Why? - I have a message for him. A message from Dougie. What's that? [LOUDER] What's that? Uh, there's a man here he says he has a message for you from Douglas Jones. Well, give it to me. Am I talking to Mr. Gordon Cole? Yes, you are. [MULLINS] Well, Dougie wanted me to read you this I am headed for Sheriff Truman's. It is 2:53 in Las Vegas, and that adds up to a ten, the number of completion. That's all he wrote. And what is your name, sir? [MULLINS] Bushnell Mullins. Lucky 7 Insurance. I'm his boss. Thank you, Mr. Mullins. Thank you very much. And that makes two of us. [DISTANT INDISTINCT CHATTER] [LOUDLY] Dougie is Cooper? How the hell is this? [DEVICES WHIRRING, BEEPING] They blew up Dougie Jones' car. Then a notorious hit man tried to shoot him outside his place of business. He's been spotted in the company of two organized-crime figures. He electrocuted himself by sticking a fork in a wall socket. That's strange, even for Cooper. A Blue Rose case, most definitely. He was hospitalized in a coma until earlier this afternoon. Pack it up! I know where he's going. [INSECTS CHIRPING] [SNORING LIGHTLY] Finally. [SNORING] - [DISTANT CELL DOOR CLANKS] - [GASPS] You fucker. Fucker. Fuck you. Fuck you.

That's my brother, Jerry Horne. Is he charged with anything? [WILLIAMS] No. I'll make arrangements to get him home. What's your name again? Sergeant Williams, Jackson Hole Police. [BEN SIGHS] [WILLIAMS] And you can send clothes. When we picked him up, he was completely naked. [SIGHS SOFTLY] Have a good day, sir.

"6","I trusted you. I invested my heart and my soul in you. - We only want to read it. - We didn't mean any harm. I thought you were different. You made me feel I could return to the world and find something decent and pure. But you're just like all the others. You lie. And you betray. And then you laugh about it. You are unclean. You have contaminated me. Now give it to me. - Donna. - Donna. No. He's not coming. He won't. He's afraid. - Did he hurt you? Are you okay? - No. I'm fine. I'm fine. I-- I'm sorry  James. It's all my fault. - I'm so sorry. - Don't cry. It's my fault too. We gotta go to the sheriff  okay? You've had enough trouble. I'll go. - No  I'll go. - James  just hold me  okay. Okay. We're all set up inside. Sluggish pulse. Pupils constricted. Breathing slow and shallow. Needle marks. Most likely heroin. Poor kid. Daddy? Can you see me? Can you see me  Daddy? Audrey  you got to stay awake. Can you catch me? - Can you? - Audrey. Talk to me  Audrey. Stay awake. Audrey? His tongue is so heavy. The hand on my throat. It hurts me. Oh  God  it hurts me. Black cold. I can't breathe. Help me  please  help me. I'm sinking. I'm sinking. All right. It's all right  Audrey  I'm right here. Audrey  I'm right here. I prayed. I prayed that you would come. And you did. It's okay. It's okay. She was so brave. I feel terrible. If anything had happened to her No more plans  okay? No more going off on our own. James  he has Laura's secret diary. He could have killed her. He could have killed you too. Pretty stupid  huh? Well  after Laura died  everything just went by kind of fast  you know. It's hard to know exactly what to believe in. Yeah. But when I saw you tonight  I knew exactly what I believed. Did you? It's like if we could put our hearts together and keep them that way forever  we'd be safe  no matter what. You and me? From now on. Yes. How is she? She is through the worst of it. Heroin. Harry. This close to a lethal dose. Hard to imagine such cruelty. Not really. Look at this. Blackie's killer. I knew I'd seen him before. - Jean Renault. - Renault? Oldest brother of Jacques and Bernard. Hell of a lot more dangerous. He runs the northern territories. Gambling  drugs  extortion  you name it. Now  I saw a tape on the TV in Blackie's office of you playing blackjack the night you and Big Ed went to the casino. Jean Renault was after me. The man who caught his brother. He planned to kill me and he used Audrey as bait. I went out of my jurisdiction. Twice. I've violated my professional code and now Audrey is paying the price. You got her back. And she's gonna be okay. This isn't the first time my actions have brought suffering to someone I care about  in the name of doing what I had to do. Damn it. I should have known better. Doesn't change the fact that she's here now  not up at Jack's with a needle in her arm. You know  you are the best lawman I've ever seen. But  Coop  sometimes you think too much. Thank you  Harry. Agent Cooper. I got your call. What happened? Did you? I was able to free your daughter without the payment. Thank God. She was being held in a brothel north of the border  known as One-Eyed Jack's. No. It seems the brothel's madam was at least partially responsible for her kidnapping and subsequent blackmail. Did you arrest her? She was killed before I could question her. No. Murdered by a man named Jean Renault. This Jean Renault  did you catch him? He escaped. Too bad. Well  everything seems to be in order. Your daughter is recovering from a drug overdose. Drug overdose? Oh  my God. She's gonna be all right. Can I see her? She's resting comfortably  I wouldn't disturb her. I'll call you in the morning. Yes. Yes  you do that  Agent Cooper. Thank you. Thank you for bringing my Audrey back to me. Good night  Mr. Horne. Poor fellow is really gone. You ain't kidding. I want you to know how much I admire you kids  standing by Mr. Johnson. Not taking the easy way out. Most people would just ship him off. Yeah  well  Leo's sort of special to us both. Believe you me  in-home care is the stuff of miracles. Mr. Johnson should benefit tremendously from being here among his loved ones. Oh  we certainly hope so. Will you be hiring full- or part-time help? Cousin Bobby and I will be here full-time. I just admire your dedication. Well  everything looks to be in order. You might want to childproof those electrical sockets. Okay. Please sign right there. - Your cheque. - Thank you. There must be a mistake. - Seven hundred bucks? - Sad  isn't it? The cost of health care is going through the roof. It's bringing rain. We're supposed to get But with figure state and local taxes  equipment fees  medical and maintenance costs  administrative fees Well  you see the results. Fortunately with you two here  Mr. Johnson will be more than adequately provided for. Good luck. I'll find my own way out. I had to quit my job  Bobby. How am I going to make it on this? - I don't know. - You don't know? It was your bright idea to bring him here in the first place. Come on  Shelly  I'm thinking  all right. You better think of something  Bobby. For the both of us. Donna  we already have Laura Palmer's diary. No  this is her secret diary. - She gave it to this Howard Smith? - Harold. - Why? - I don't know why. To hide it or something. Did he ever actually show you the diary? No. But he read from it. I saw her name on the inside cover. - Her handwriting. - Are you and James up to something? He has been warned not to get mixed up-- James has nothing to do with this. Donna  it is a lot like the boy who cried wolf. The last time you played this game  Dr. Jacoby ended up in a hospital bed. It's not a game. All right. I'll try to get someone out there to take a look. But my hands are full. I can't promise anything. Excuse me  I'm looking for a Sheriff Harry S. Truman. - You found him. - Sheriff  please. Excuse me  I'm looking for Sheriff Harry S. Truman. - That's me. - Federal Bureau of Investigation Regional Bureau Chief  Gordon Cole. That's a real mouthful  but I can't hear myself anyway. I'm Agent Cooper's supervisor. - Pleasure to meet you. - Can I speak with you a moment? Sure. Donna. Wait here. And who did you say you were? - I'm Sheriff Truman. - Great. Pay dirt. You have to speak up  sheriff  hearing's gone. Long story. Got these things cranked up to the max. Are you looking for Agent Cooper? When an agent goes down in the field  I jump right up and pay a visit. Agent Cooper's not here right now. Albert Rosenfield will not be coming back  but I've got his lab report right here. Item: A Vicuna coat. Albert found fibres in the hall outside of Cooper's room from a Vicuna coat. Coat was Vicuna? Sounds real good  sheriff  but I already ate. Also got a lab report from Albert on the one-armer's syringe. Albert has never seen a drug like it. A combo. Really weird stuff. What else does Albert say? Papers. Papers found near the bloody towel down the train tracks from the crime site. - From a diary. - Please. There's the one-armer now. Since when is selling shoes against the law? Mr. Gerard  we need to ask you a few questions. Why don't we move over to my office. - My office. - Right. She looks like an angel. Audrey? Audrey? Your father is here. Thank God  Audrey. Thank God. I was so worried about you. Were you? I was worried sick. You know  it's times like these that make a man aware of the value of life. Every raindrop  every sunset. I'm aware of a lot of new things too  Daddy. Now  we will get you home  safe  warm  in your own bed. What a terrible experience  terrible people. - The things that you must have seen. - I saw so much. We'll sort it out. Together. Yes  Daddy. You and I. That's my girl. My car is outside. I'll take her home now. - Daddy? - Yes  darling. I would like Agent Cooper to take me home if that's all right. Fine. Maybe Maybe we could all go together. Hi  Ed. I'm home. Isn't this the swellest dress you have ever seen? Do you know they didn't look at me twice when I used the charge card? Say  Ed  when do my parents get back from Europe  anyway? Well  pretty soon. It's neat having the place all to ourselves. Pretend it's ours. Like we were married or something. Well  we can do that. Nadine-- And there's some other stuff we can do too. Well  like what? You know  silly. You know what I was thinking? Tonight maybe we could go park by the lake  and neck. Wait a minute. We don't have to go anywhere. Why  we can just stay right here. You've kept yourself in fine nick  Josie. Sapphire earrings  Parisian perfume  cashmere sweaters. Please go. One-way ticket. Seattle  Hong Kong. - I have one more day. - Keep what you earn. See what you can fit into your suitcases. We leave tonight. I haven't received my insurance money. Ben Horne hasn't paid me yet either. I waited for this for five years. Mr. Eckhardt will make it more than worth your while. You can't make me leave. Be adaptable. We had an arrangement. Sheriff Truman is important to you. You lied to him. You made him into a fool. But he is important to you nonetheless. Leave with me tonight. Or I'll kill him. He doesn't know anything. The plane leaves at midnight. Be there. Or I'll come for you and your sheriff. That's the arrangement. - Hi. - Hi. I think I owe you an apology. Not really. When we were to together  you know  just talking  I felt something. I just wasn't sure. You looked at me and you saw Laura. I guess I did. Wanna know something kind of strange? What? I liked it. You did? When we were growing up  Laura and I were so close. It was scary. I could feel her thoughts  like our brains were connected or something. And when she died suddenly  I got the chance to be Laura. At least other people saw me that way. Like the way that you looked at me. I liked that too. But it was wrong. It wasn't one thing or the other. For a while  I got to be somebody different. But now I'm just me again. James  you and Donna belong together. That's the best thing. - It's just hard sometimes  you know? - How? If you really love someone  it's like this bright light is shining on you all the time. You're right in it and it's great. But I just don't think you can be that way all the time. Sure you can. Well  I want to. I want to try to make the way my heart feels last forever. Pretty weird. I'm going home tomorrow  James. I came to Twin Peaks for Laura's funeral. But now it's time to go. So is this goodbye? I guess it is. Bye  James. To the fire. Now  to what do I owe the pleasure of this call? I've got the contract with Pete's signature. And I want my money. Of course you do. All of it. Now. Before you get this. Josie  Josie. Surely a mind as quicksilver as your own can grasp the complicated position that we're in. Fluidity is everything  you know. Now  I can't summon up cash reserves that I don't have. But I have already and I will be happy to assure you again that as soon as the contracted payments arrive from Iceland  your percentage will immediately be your pistol. I won't leave this office without my money. Why do I sense that this isn't a negotiable position? You're under some kind of pressure  aren't you? Do not play games with me. Games? Josie  this key unlocks my personal hotel safe. Now  in that safe  I have put together a fascinating dossier on you  my dear  and your late husband-- Andrew's little boat that went boom. So you behave yourself  lady  or believe me when I say that I will bury you. That's a shame. Because if anything unfortunate were to happen to me  it would lead authorities to a certain safety deposit box in a bank in another city  inside of which there is enough evidence to lock you away for three lifetimes. They will bury us side by side. Stalemate. Your move. Cash. Happily  I can accommodate you. Sign of good faith. Tokyo bank. Five million dollars. We are finished. Josie. Well played. Leo. We sort of figured with you getting out and all. Well  what the hell  we sort of wanted to give you a little party. Our way of saying  ""Hey  Leo Johnson  welcome home. "" Welcome home  darling. Because you're a special guy  Leo. And we just want you to know that we remember all the great stuff you did for the ones you loved. Like Shelly here. Who could ask for a more caring and thoughtful husband? Making her clean your dirty clothes. Wash your dishes. Mop your floors. You're a class act  man. - Top to bottom. - Class act. And how about Leo Johnson  wife abuser? There's a guy I want to party with. Soap in a sock. Internal injuries and barely leaves a bruise. And last  but I'm thinking  not least  we got Leo Johnson  murderer. Hang your wife up like a piece of meat. Leaving her to burn. Don't let anybody ever tell you you don't know how to treat a woman  buddy. This is your life  Leo Johnson. You deserve it. Every damn minute. He moved. - This is too creepy. I don't like this. - Okay. Okay  Shel-- Okay  maybe you're right. I mean  I don't want to exploit him or nothing. Sorry  Leo. We sort of got carried away. No need to make your rehabilitation any more difficult than it already is. Doc Hayward said you needed familiar stimulus. So we just figured  what the hell kazoos. Honest  Leo. Shelly and me are going to do everything we can to make you feel safe and happy. Hey  cake. You want some cake? Oh  look at that. Ice cream. Bobby. Hey  Leo. Oh  jeez. Man  you gotta be more careful. Good thing we didn't light the candles. Agent Dale Cooper. Gordon  I hope you haven't been waiting too long. I didn't just get here. I've been waiting the whole afternoon to see you. What can I do for you? No matter whatsoever. No apology necessary. Gave me a chance to meet the local law enforcement team. A great bunch. Cooper. You remind me today of a small Mexican Chihuahua. Can I speak to you a moment in private? Of course  Gordon. Harry  can we use your office? You might ask the sheriff if we could use his office. Go right ahead. Follow me  Gordon. I believe in secrecy  Coop. I'll make this fast. I didn't want to say anything in front of the men. It's Albert's opinion that you might be getting in over your head. This worries me  Coop. I feel a certain responsibility. - Albert is wrong  Gordon. - You went into the chute in Pittsburgh. And I want to make doubly sure  in fact triply sure  that it does not happen again. Copy? Pittsburgh was a different story. I was wounded in Pittsburgh  Gordon  but beyond that  the case bears no similarities. I must say you look all right. Trace of circles under the eyes  catch up on your sleep. But restless nights and uneasy dreams go with the territory. I am tired  Gordon. There is much work to be done. But mind  body and spirit are up to the task. Without a doubt  I'm A-okay. Proud of you  Coop. Now  Gordon. What the hell is this about a Mexican Chihuahua? You've got a problem of a different sort here. Two and two do not always equal four. You ought to know  we can hear everything you're saying out in the hall. - Come on in. - Why don't you invite the sheriff on in. An anonymous letter sent to home base with your name on it. Looks kind of familiar  doesn't it? It's a chess deal. Looks like a chess deal. It's an opening move from Windom Earle. Windom Earle. Bless your heart  Coop. We're gonna have to watch your back from now on. With Jerry on the road  well I need you back here. Let's just say that I have a much better sense of what you've been through - in the last few weeks. - I appreciate that  Ben. And I appreciate the confidence. Really I do. If it weren't for your indictment  I could drop you into your old slot. You know  our friendship  our history together. But first  I need to know that you're okay. I'm 100 percent  Ben  110 percent. Let me prove it to you. We've taken a payment from the Icelanders on Ghostwood  but there's a group from the Orient that wants in  in the worst way. Jerry is on his way to Tokyo to check them out  and probably every geisha within a hundred miles. I'm about to take Mr. Big to dinner. We need to buy a little time here. Well  the first thing we do is resurvey the land. Required because of the fire. Then we set up a whole parade of inspectors  federal  county  state  until Jerry gets back with a full report. If there's any money  we can run it thru the Caymans. Pick up some money on the exchange rate. And if we have to  we can drop escrow into a black hole for six months. That's my Leland. Josie? Harry  I don't believe you have met my assistant  Mr. Lee. Pleased to meet you. I'll take these to car. - What are you doing? - I'm going away. Where? Why? Harry. Josie. I always called you from here. And then  it was here I could talk to you and be everything you wanted me to be. Well  then stay here. I sold the mill. It's over. I'm going home. No. I'm sorry  don't think badly of me. Mr. Lee  leave us alone. Josie  you can't leave. You saying this as the police? No. It's best if you forget about me. I love you. Josie  I love you. - Would you like a drink  Mr. Tojamura? - No  thank you. You have my cashier's cheque for 5 million. I have nothing. Why? Well I know so little about you  Mr. Tojamura. This is a small community. I'm being careful. Trying to be sensitive to local concerns. You must understand the impact this project will have on the community. You waste my time. We shall withdraw. Oh  no. Please  Mr. Tojamura. Consider the position that I'm in. The mill fire created a raft of unforeseen problems  psychic as well as financial. I feel it's my duty as a civic leader to help foster the healing process. Even at the temporary expense of my larger business opportunities. I know a little about fire. My family was at Nagasaki. I'm sorry. Getting to know you Getting to know all about you Getting to like you Getting to hope you like me Getting to know you Would you excuse me a moment? --but nicely You are precisely my cup of tea Where might you folks be from  sir? - Right here in Twin Peaks. - That's terrific. How about those Steeplejacks  huh? Getting to know you Getting to feel free and easy When I am near you Getting to know what to say Haven't you noticed Suddenly I'm bright and breezy? Because of all the beautiful And new things I am learning about you Day by day Thank you  ladies and gentlemen. Thank you. Great Northern audiences are the greatest in the world. Thank you. Good night. - Drive carefully. - The King and I. Give it a rest  Leland. Temporary insanity  huh? Hopefully some of these people will be on your jury. You will be home free. You like musicals? No. Not even Fiddler on the Roof? It made me weep like a little baby. I find the adherence to fantasy troubling and unreasonable. Yeah. You're not from around here  are you? I am a visitor. Yeah. Well  could I buy you a sake? No  thank you. Or how about a nice cold milk? Please give me my medicine. - I can feel the change. - What change? The drug found in his possession contains trace elements usually found in Haloperidol. Do you suffer from schizophrenia? - Multiple personalities? - It's too late. You know this man  don't you? Why'd you lie when I questioned you? - It wasn't me. Don't you understand? - Give him the drug  chief. - Not yet. - If we give him the drug  Coop  you'll never see the other side. - Give him the medicine. - No. There is no need for medicine. I am not in pain. Who are you? - My name is Mike. - What are you? I am an inhabiting spirit. Who is Philip Gerard? He is host to me. You spoke to me in my dream about Bob. He was my familiar. Where does Bob come from? That cannot be revealed. What does Bob want? He is Bob  eager for fun. He wears a smile  everybody run. Do you understand the parasite? It attaches itself to a life form and feeds. Bob requires a human host. He feeds on fear and the pleasures. They are his children. I am similar to Bob. We once were partners. - Through the darkness of future past - Through the darkness of future past - The magician longs to see - The magician longs to see One chance out between two worlds Fire walk with me But then I saw the face of God and was purified. I took off the arm. But remained close to this vessel. Inhabiting from time to time for one single purpose. - To find Bob. - To stop him. This is his true face. But few can see it. The gifted and the damned. Is Bob near us now? For nearly 40 years. Where? A large house made of wood. Surrounded by trees. The house is filled with many rooms  each alike. But occupied by different souls. Night after night. The Great Northern Hotel."

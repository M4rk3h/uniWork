"7","Previously on   Twin Peaks   You 'll put me to work behind the perfume counter. Does that clear things up? So where do I start? Washing dishes will be fine. Donna it's Maddy. I found a tape in her hiding place. I'll meet you and James tomorrow and bring a tape recorder. Why would an apartment dweller like Jacques buy so much heating oil? To heat a log cabin. - What did you see that night? - Two men two girls. Screams. We'll give Josie a chance to sell tomorrow. You do realise the risk if anyone sees us. Don't touch me! Don't come near me Leo! Don't make me leave please. Don't make me leave. Audrey you 're a high school girl. I'm an agent of the FBI. So do you want me to leave or what? What I want and what I need are two different things Audrey. When a man joins the Bureau he takes an oath to uphold certain values. Values that he's sworn to live by. This is wrong Audrey. We both know it. - But don't you like me? - I like you very much. You 're beautiful intelligent desirable. Everything a man wants in his life. But what you need right now more than anything is a friend. Someone who will listen. Friends huh? I'm gonna go and get us two malts and some fries. - Then tell me all your troubles. - That could take all night. The night is young. Now I'm gonna get the food and you 're gonna get dressed. - I can't tell you all my secrets. - Secrets are dangerous things. - Do you have any? - No. Laura had a lot of secrets. Finding those out is my job. Good morning Officer Brennan. I sure wish you would stop calling me Officer Brennan. Officer Andy this is peak activity time at the station switchboard. So it's really not convenient for me to talk right now. Twin Peaks Sheriff's Station may I help you? One moment please. Doctor Stanicek? Yes it's me. Oh. Uh-huh. Well thank you Doctor. No I'm fine. Bye. Morning Lucy. I heard you were out sick. I'm much better today thanks. Good. I found it:   Gracula religiosa.   Commonly known as the hill mynah.   Native to Southeast Asia Indonesia.   Feeds on fruit mainly some invertebrates.   Its ability to mimic the human voice is amazing.    Yeah well so far we haven't heard a peep. Hey Waldo what's up? It says here that mimicry is a kind of play with the mynah. But this one's in a weakened condition. Starved dehydrated. I'd say he's feeling anything but playful. Here you go little fella. - You want to feed him Agent Cooper? - I don't like birds. When do you think he'll start talking? According to the book his urge to mimic should return with his health. - If it does then we got a witness. - Well we better keep feeding him. - You got any apples? - Yeah. There's some in the fridge. - These grapes are on the edge. - These came in from your office. Forensics confirms Jacques had three guests to his cabin: Laura Palmer Ronnette Pulaski and Leo Johnson. That was the only exposed negative on the roll of film. Look familiar? - That's our Waldo. - No Harry the girl. That's Laura. Well now we know who and when. We don't know why. Voice activated Harry. When the bird talks maybe we'll get some answers. This matches the fragment found in Laura's stomach. - A chip from One-Eyed Jacks. - Renault deals in the casino. - A little fieldwork is in order. - Jacks is over the border. Well I know that Harry. That's why I was thinking this would be a job for the Bookhouse Boys. Better call Hawk on that one. Shelly! Bobby Briggs. Come on lover-boy. Leo's waiting. - I called but your dad answered. - Bobby's here baby. Bobby's here. I shot him Bobby. I know I did. He just screamed and screamed. He sounded like an animal. You what? Slow down Shelly. Talk to me. He's out there I know he is. He's gonna kill me. - Bobby he's gonna kill me. - Shelly! Start over. Go real slow. Leo came home late last night. He was all beat up. He had blood all over him. I told him I was never ever gonna let him hurt me again. But he came at me. So I pulled the trigger. I shot him Bobby. What am I gonna do? Where am I gonna hide? Shelly Leo Johnson is history. Understand? I'm taking care of you from now on. I'm gonna deal with Leo. I'm gonna deal with James. Bobby's gonna deal with everything. Birdseed? No this bird eats fruit. The sheriff says it's a witness. No not just because it saw something because it talks. It needs to eat What's up Doc? Just a few words before I go to sleep. I feel like I'm gonna dream tonight. Big bad ones you know? The kind you like. It's easier talking into the recorder. I guess I feel I can say anything. All my secrets. The naked ones. I know you like those Doc. I know you like me too. That'll be my little secret OK? Just like your coconut. Why is it so easy to make men like me? And I don't even have to try very hard. Or maybe if it was harder This one's empty. February 23rd. The night Laura died. - The tape's not in there. - He must still have it. - She died he never returned it. - Do you think Dr Jacoby killed her? We're gonna find that tape. Tonight. - Where? - Jacoby's office. - What if he's there? - We'll get him out. How? Maybe he gets a phone call. From Laura. What's up Doc? Just a few words before I go to sleep. I feel like I'm gonna dream tonight. Here try this. It smells like a florist. This won't do. I want something more fruity. - Fruity? - As in fruit. Jenny could I see you in my office in five minutes? I'm not making myself clear. I want to make a statement. Maybe you should try hanging it around your neck. It's a perfume it's a fashion accessory. Two statements for the price of one. I don't appreciate your attitude. Well thank you for shopping at Horne's Department Store. - I'm going to the girls' room. - OK. There's a real bad accident outside. It sounded like a bus or something. Come right this way Jenny. I have something really special to talk about today. Come right in. My my you look lovely. - Sit sit. - Thank you Mr Battis. This is for you Jenny. A reward for a job well done. It's a unicorn. Ancient symbol of purity. Tamed only by the young at heart. Wow a unicorn. - Have a good time at the club? - I had a great time Mr Battis. They were pleased with you as well I must say. They'd like you to continue. Believe me not many girls qualify. - Really? - Yes. Now the variety of work is completely up to you. Hostess cocktail waitress. Or if you are chosen hospitality girl. What's that? Hospitality girls escort important guests VIPs. It's a lucrative opportunity Jenny. Attending to wealthy men in need of a little company. That sounds cool. As long as they're wealthy. Jenny your attitude will take you far in this life. Call this number ask for Black Rose. Why don't we go to Eveningwear and find you something elegant? Elegant sounds great Mr Battis. Elegant. How do you feel about rose? Ronnette Pulaski. In prison you remember faces from home. Even people you barely knew seem like friends. - It's something to hang on to. - Must've been hard on you. I paid my debt that's what counts. You were a really big help around here. I wanna thank you for getting Norma through. You 're welcome Hank. It's no problem. She told me in her letters how much it meant how much Pete helped. - Pete? - Yeah. No not Pete - No you mean Ed. - Yeah Big Ed. Yeah I'm a little better at faces than names I guess. Yeah Big Ed. Shelly can we get another cup over here? - Hello Hank. - Hi Harry. Glad to see me? You looking for a free lunch? - I recommend the meatloaf. - Well save it. I'm looking for you. - Harry I'm innocent. - What you are is on parole. You pay your case officer a visit once a week Fridays. You miss a visit you go to jail. Got it? Thanks for the reminder Sheriff. Stop in any time. You think people really change Cooper? I don't. Oh afternoon guys. Would you like some coffee? - Afternoon Shelly. Yes. - We should be on our way. Harry I'm gonna let you in on a little secret. Every day once a day give yourself a present. Don't plan it don't wait for it just let it happen. Could be a new shirt a catnap in your office chair or two cups of good hot black coffee. - Like this. - A present. - Like Christmas? - Yeah. Man that hits the spot. Nothing like a great cup of black coffee. Bye Audrey. - So did Battis get you a dress? - Yeah he did. - Me too. I'm gonna be hostess. - Oh really. Cool. - Get one of these too? - What will I do with a horned horse? - Ditto. I bet he's cartons of them. - He probably does. God I did a really dumb thing. I lost that number he gave me for Black Rose do you have it? - Yeah. I got it. - Great. Here. Thanks. - OK I'll talk to you later. - OK see you tomorrow. I wasn't fooling Montana. You show them Chet. You show all of them. Tune in tomorrow for   Invitation to Love  . Ed. I'm eating bonbons. - Come on honey. It's not that bad. - You don't know how bad it is. You don't know all the things I was gonna do for us. I know. A new TV. I was gonna do that. - I already looked at a motorboat. - Sweetheart It wasn't just things I was gonna buy. It was the new life we were gonna lead. Nadine there's plenty of patent attorneys. We just gotta find one who understands drape runners. Rejected. Rejected that's what he said. - Nobody will say anything different. - Don't give up. Don't you dare. I just got that baby back from Tim and Tom's Taxidermy. When I caught him he was this big. I guess by the time they take the innards out and put the stuffing in it loses something in the translation. Well Pete it's still a fine looking trophy no matter what the size. Yeah well size isn't everything I guess. Harry I didn't expect you to be here. I'm late for the mill but I'll make time for us. What's wrong? What were you doing at the Timber Falls Motel Tuesday? - Tuesday I was at the mill. - Hawk saw you. I know you were there. Harry You can tell me anything. Josie you can tell me anything. I was there because Ben and Catherine were there together. I followed them and I took pictures. What's this all about? You asked me for proof last time and I followed them and I took pictures. The other night I heard Catherine talking on the phone. Something about an accident. A fire. A fire at the mill. A fire at Andrew's mill. My mill. I'm not gonna let this happen. No. Neither will I. I won't let it happen. - Well now. - Evening Harry. Ed you all set? - Is that what you 're wearing? - It's pretty spiffy. Like to gamble Ed? I went to Reno once. But I never felt too lucky. Well you 're gonna be lucky tonight. It's $10 000 of the Bureau 's money. Whenever I gamble I bring back 10 to How about 300? And Ed the suit is perfect. Well Harry'd like to talk with you. So why don't I see you outside? Yeah Harry what's on your mind? I'm worried about Josie. She's been real afraid. - About what? - Ben Horne and Catherine Martell. They've seen each other on the side for years Josie just found out. She thinks they're planning to burn down the mill and get rid of her. Well do you believe her? Ben Horne wants that land for Ghostwood development and Josie won't sell. - Yeah I believe her. - How much do you know about her? Where she's from? Who she was before? - What are you getting at? - The truth. That's my job. I know all I need to know. I love her and she's in trouble. That's good enough for me. Let's look into it. Thanks. - Is Hawk ready? - Yeah he's outside in the van. - I got that new Cadillac you wanted. - Good. It's perfect for our cover. - High rollers from the Tri-Cities? - Oral surgeons Harry. Big spenders vacationing among the firs. Yeah has Agent Cooper returned yet? I need to leave another message. Tell him that Audrey called again. Yes it's still urgent. - Thanks for seeing me Mrs Martell. - It's all right. - Normally I never impose this late. - That's fine. What's this about? Every agent is instructed five signatures and somehow we missed one. - Refresh my memory. What policy? - Your new life insurance. Since the binder takes effect tonight I had no choice. It couldn't wait. Right here please. Is everything in order Mrs Martell? Yes it's just This was handled without our meeting each other and I'd almost forgotten. To be honest with you Mrs Martell I withheld that last page. - Did you? - I admit I thought it unusual. Life insurance and the client is too busy to be involved? I mean you did know about this policy didn't you? Are you suggesting that there's something irregular at work here? I never got that idea from Mrs Packard. Or from Mr Horne. When he offered to collect signatures I thought it was fine. Just with a new account I like to be certain to cross every   t  . Right here please. You know I'm noticing there are some minor changes that I asked my attorney to make that are not included in this draft. I'd like to go over this with him in the morning and initial the changes and get the documents to you at that time. If there's anything that I can do to help you with the policy or anything at all - Are you an ambitious man Mr Neff? - One likes to think so. One never knows. There may be a few   t's   left to cross. - Goodnight. - Mrs Martell. I'll see myself out. Think. Think. Ed why don't you open that up? Wow. Look at all this. Well I'm sorry. There's a curly-haired wig in there. Ed it's gonna work like gangbusters. I'll help you on with one of those moustaches. - Will it fit? I've got a big head. - OK give it a try. Testing: One two.

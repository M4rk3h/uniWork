Where shall we start? Maybe this is something. Umbrellas?   The Kahala Hilton July 1969 men on the moon     August 9th 1974      I first lay eyes on Mimsy.    - Weird! - Yeah. - James! - What d'you do? - I just hit a button. - Hit it again. There's gotta be a way to turn it off. My little coconut. James! Laura said something on her tape about a coconut. Oh my God the necklace! OK Laura this is where you shot that video. Now just tell me Tell me why you sent me to Sparkwood and 21? Oh my God! No! - Red 36. - Sorry I guess our date's off. - 77. - Pay red. No let it ride. Excuse me can I get? Sir are you absolutely sure you want another card? Yes please. Twenty-one! Can you beat that? Mother always said I was born lucky. Maybe later. Thanks for asking. This is for you. I'm a friend of Leo's. Who's Leo? Buy you a cocktail Jacques? Come in. Turn around. Yes Very nice. Come over here. - Something wrong? - Uh-uh. This is a good night for you to break in. The owner's coming by he likes to spend time with the new girls. - Who's that? - No names child. You don't offer and you don't ask. Yes ma'am. Pick a card. - How long you been dealing Blackjack? - Long enough to spot a card counter. You let card counters buy you a drink? I don't see tips like that everyday. - Leo ever mention me to you? - I don't know Mr. Who are you? I can't believe Leo never told you about me. - Maybe he did I don't know. - Leo played you like a violin. He had you taking all the risk and never cut you a piece of the action. I don't know what you 're talking about. Take that chip out of your pocket and take a look. Go ahead. That chip has a special significance. A very special night you spent up at your cabin. Here's a clue.   Laura! Laura!   Come on take it easy. Take it easy! How do you think a low-rent hump like Leo has been financing this? You I'm the bank. - He never mentioned your name. - Course not. Leo buys with my cash and you mule it across the border. - He tell you who's distributing Stateside? - No. - Some high school kid - That's right. We're in sync now Jacques can you feel it? Can you? - Yeah yeah sure. - Good. 'Cause I've got a job for you tonight. No Leo. No middleman. It's ten grand. Half now half on completion. How's that sound? Sounds good. What are we doing? Meet me at the plant on Black Lake in two hours. - Is that going to be a problem? - No. No problem. Good. One more question Jacques. Leo told me all about that night at the cabin with the girls. I'm curious about the chip. How'd that happen? - It was that crazy bird. - Bird? It had a thing for Laura saying her name all the time like he's in love or something. So we're all partying. The girls are getting high everybody's crazy - You Laura and Ronnette. - Leo lets Waldo out of the cage The birdie lands on her shoulder. Laura's all tied up. Oh she liked that. The birdy starts pecking on her shoulder like love pecks. Know what I mean? So Leo he's doing a number on her and she's screaming about that damn bird. So Leo takes out a chip puts it in her mouth and says   Bite the bullet baby.      Bite the bullet.    Thanks for clearing that up. Yeah no problem. - See you on the other side. - Can do Cappy. Got a trout on the line Hawk. This one's a keeper. - I'm just gonna sit here OK? - Come here sweetie. Look we got all night baby! Aren't you? Yeah. I'm just gonna put this Yes You made me do this Shelly. You made me! Is Lucy talking to you yet? As we say in the law enforcement game   It's a cold trail.    Ah women! Harry? Hawk here. The trout's heading upstream towards the net. Hawk hold the line. We'll set the hook. - You got a 20 on Agent Cooper? - He's downstream ten minutes. He'll probably miss the catch but he'll be there when we grill him. Copy that. We'll make our move as soon as the big fish shows his fins. Ready Andy? Ready Harry. Keep your hands where I can see them! - Put them on the roof of the car! - You heard him! Get in there and cuff him. Don't move! You 're under arrest for the attempted murder of Ronnette Pulaski and the murder of Laura Palmer. Give me your other hand. - He's got my gun! - Harry look out! Andy? - Are you OK Harry? - Yeah. - Better call that ambulance. - Yeah. held against you in a court of law you have a right to an attorney Hello? All clear. I'll be there as soon as I can. Hey what's up Doc? It's Laura in case you haven't guessed. It's Thursday 23rd and I'm so bored. Actually I'm in kind of a weird mood. God James is sweet but he's so dumb. And right now I can only take so much of sweet! Hey remember that mystery man I told you about? Well if I tell you his name then you 're going to be in trouble. He wouldn't be a mystery man anymore but you might be history man! I think a couple of times he's tried to kill me. But guess what? As you know I sure got off on it. Isn't sex weird? This guy can really light my F-l-R-E. As in red Corvette. Uh-oh! Here comes Mom with milk and cookies. - Donna? - Dad! Bye-bye. I've got an emergency at the hospital. See if your mother needs anything. I'll call later. James It's OK I'm glad I heard her say it. I'm glad. I might have gone my whole life - I'm sorry you had to hear that. - I'm OK. Jacoby didn't kill her. He was trying to help her. Then how did he get the necklace? Do you hear that? You 've got one hour to think about what you 've done to me. And think about it! 'Cause by then Bobby Briggs is gonna be dead! You broke my heart! Goodbye. It's all here. Very generous Josie. Sitting in that concrete box all that time all the money in creation. It kept me going. It's a funny thing. Back in the world I don't know it seems kind of light. We had an agreement. I've been going over this in my mind and If you could follow my thinking We're all born into life we have a certain number of years to breathe and have our being. That's from a book on Oriental philosophy I read in the joint. Maybe somebody somewhere knows how much time we have. I don't. Do you? So when a man gives up a portion of his life 18 months for instance how does he place a value on that time? What's that? 5 000 a month? Not bad if you live another 50 years but what if you 've only another 20? Or ten? Or some unforeseen event kills you tomorrow? Like the boating accident that killed your late husband Andrew. Or say you just got out of prison where you went in for vehicular manslaughter as part of an agreement to avoid being implicated in a greater crime murder for which in fact you were responsible. But now there's this threat this possible threat that this fact could be discovered. And in one stroke could be cut right out from underneath you. So I've been asking myself what does that do to the market value of 18 months? We had an agreement. And we still do sweetheart. Signed sealed delivered. And I want to take care of everything we agreed to. You want a lot for your money and I want a lot for my time. There's a saying in the joint. It's not Oriental philosophy but it has a similar logic that appeals to my spiritual nature.   Once you 're in business with somebody you 're in business for life.    Like a marriage. Partner. Damn! Where is it? Where is it? Catherine? The account ledger have you seen it? Don't you keep it in that little safe at home? It's not in the safe at home it's not anywhere! - Tell me you didn't take it. - I didn't take it. Pete tell me the truth. You 're not helping her to pull something here. - Who? - Josie. No! - Pull what here? - Oh Peter. Forget everything we've ever done to hurt each other. - Just like that! - Temporarily. Our marriage is a living train wreck but there used to be something caring between us. The fella who caught my eye. The lumberjack who could scamper up a tree like a cat. The boss's sister from that big house on the hill. A summer's indiscretion and here we are. Catherine! Oh Pete! I never should have taken you to that house on the hill. Well I have no complaints about the house. As for me taking my pleasure in lashing out at the one person who was decent enough to stand by me through all my foolishness. I know things haven't been easy for you. Peter Somewhere under all that scar tissue there's the faintest flicker of what we once felt. I'm asking you to feel that now. Why exactly? Because I'm in trouble. Given what I've become and how I've treated people there's no one else I can turn to. I need your help. Catherine! Catherine! So Fred starts to cuff him and Harry turns to go. Suddenly Jacques throws an elbow at Fred WHAM! In one move he takes Fred's gun and he's got the drop on Harry. Harry is deader than a pound of roadside stew! Then all of a sudden a single shot rings out. - Andy my man! - All right Andy! Go ahead Andy give it your best shot! Go on! Oh Andy! Oh Punky I'm pregnant. Uh-oh! Fresh coffee. - What? - Let me talk to the sheriff. The sheriff isn't in at the moment. Would you care to leave a message? You tell him Leo Johnson said to check out James Hurley. - He's an easy rider. - An easy rider? - You got that? - Yes but Leo wait! Leo! Did you take Laura and Ronnette up to your cabin that night? They'd both been up there before. They was no nuns! That's where you took the pictures for   Flesh World  ? That was Laura's idea. She talked Ronnette into making them ads. What did you and Leo fight about that night? Bastard hit me with a whiskey bottle! - Why? - I don't know that's why we fought! I'm bleeding like a stuck pig and he's laughing. So you used Leo's shirt to stop the bleeding. What then? I got sick. I go outside pass out. I wake up I'm laying on the ground. - Where was Leo? - Leo and the girls they're gone. - What about the train car? - I don't know nothing about that. I come down the hill Leo's car is gone. Had to walk 15 miles back to my own house. When they brought him in he was rambling incoherently. These things he said to you they're pretty incredible. I know. Let's hope he pulls through. Well he's stabilised anyway. So Leo had to take the girls to the train car by himself? - You believe him? - He's too stupid to lie. He'll testify against Leo we got him. We got to find Leo first. - Doc how's Jacoby? - He's out of the woods. Listen he says he got a phone call from Laura Palmer. He was on his way to see her when he was jumped. - Any description of the assailant? - He didn't see him. But he says he saw Laura Palmer by the gazebo in Easter Park. It's not here! It's not here! It's not here either. Damn! Oh Midge! Midge Jones. What are you doing? It's my old high school yearbook. I thought it was gone forever. Oh Pete. Sorry. What? It's at the mill. - What is? - What you 're looking for. Drying shed three near the north gate. Pete Yes I'll look in the other room. What do you want? Talk terms. We'll let you know. Norma you still have that down comforter on your bed? Yes Hank. The mattresses they give you on your bunk they're probably this thick you know. And you lie there at night thinking   If this mattress is so skinny how did they get all those rocks inside?   So you 'll forgive me if I tell you that night after night I dreamed of you lying on that big feather bed. I guess the hired help shouldn't be so familiar with the boss lady eh? I can't blame you for dreaming. I wasn't just dreaming about being with you Norma. What I was trying to - I shouldn't be saying this much. - I think you should. No I haven't earned the right Norma. I've been back what? Two days. Say what you want to say. I've been trying to picture a whole life with you with the diner. Making it soar. Making it blue sky. I always talk too big that's my biggest fault. I learned that talking to my counsellor inside. This is new territory for me. But I'm gonna try. You know it's 20 years we've been together next month. Can you believe it? Maybe we're doing this all backwards. Maybe it's the next 20 that counts. Give me time Norma. I'll make you proud of me yet. Nadine? Nadine? Honey? Oh God! Nadine don't you do this. Nadine! I need an ambulance. My wife has just taken some pills. For the love of God hurry! Stay with me Nadine. Please don't go. Stay with me. Leo Johnson's gone to ground. I bet he's holed up near his home. - Sheriff Leo Johnson called. - When? Ten minutes ago. He left this message. And Sheriff in the background I could hear a clock striking. - What kind of clock Lucy? - Like the clock at Easter Park. - Harry! - Hawk. Good work Lucy. Pull surveillance off Leo's house. Set up a perimeter around Easter Park. - Got it. - You get some cars over there. Harry I gotta talk to you Harry let me talk to James. You want to investigate this? Come on James. Harry Harry is it true? - You 've found the killer? - We've arrested a suspect. - But is it him Harry? - I can't release any details now. I'm sorry. Excuse me. Leland there's nothing you can do here. You should be home with Sarah now. Yes you 're right. Of course you 're right. - You 're going back to the hospital? - No I'm heading home. - Thank you Will. - Don't give it a thought. Hospital I think you ought to listen to this tape. Why's that? It was Laura's. We found it. I think it'll help you find who you 're looking for. - Who might that be? - Somebody with a red Corvette. Doctor Jacoby's in hospital with a heart attack. - Heart attack? - He said he saw Laura tonight. What kind of dangerous game have you been playing? Is Jacoby gonna be all right? I've been very patient with you James. From here on out I'm gonna need a better set of answers. Let's start with why this was in the gas tank of your bike? Fine fine fine. OK. OK. Ghostwood fantastic! I love it! All your revisions are included. Ben I am so happy I can't even say how much. - After you. - No no no! After you. After me! Excuse me. Benjamin Horne here. Time to black flag that little firebug. Leo Johnson's gonna get a house call. Proceed. Shelly? Shelly are you here? - Shelly's not here Bobby. - Leo! - Am I glad to see you - Something I can help you with? It's you I was looking for. The cops are after you. Liar! Shelly's dead! You killed her! Leo! Later Leo. I can't understand a word you have a thing in your mouth. - Who are you? - Shelly Johnson. - You know who called me here? - No. Please help me. Be quiet I'm thinking. Oh God. Oh God! - Any of the boys still inside? - Not sure. Shift was over but we're still trying to get a count. - Seen Catherine? - No Pete. That's her car. Jesus God! You think she's still inside? I guess I'm gonna have to find out. Pete that ain't such a good idea. She's still my wife. Catherine! And that is that! Ben is this a great moment? - Ghostwood! - Incredible! Ghostwood eh? Einar tonight you play on the house. This is marvellous. Enjoy my friend enjoy! To Ghostwood. To Ghostwood Estates and Country Club! Congratulations Boss. Blackie old pal this calls for a celebration. Let's have a look at the new girl. Good luck honey. Close your eyes. This is such stuff as dreams are made of. Diane 4:37 am. After a long investigative night returning to the Great Northern. One suspect in custody. Leo Johnson who I believe killed Laura Palmer won't be able to escape the dragnet much longer. As you can hear from the ambient sound around me and I notice with some relief the Icelandic group on my floor have either checked or passed out I may not need the earplugs which I received today Diane although I may put them to use as a precautionary measure. I ordered hot milk from room service. Here's hoping that does the job and I can catch some quality sack time. achievement of modern civilisation.   My Special Agent  . Cooper here. Who is this? Could this wait till tomorrow morning? Please excuse me I've got room service. We found him We found Leo Johnson. He's been shot. Agent Cooper?

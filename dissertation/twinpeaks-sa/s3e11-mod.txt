You're gonna have to pay for the door and the damage to the apartment. I'm not paying for her apartment. - Becky. - I'm not going to do it. I don't have any money, anyway! [Bobby] Honey, if I didn't work for the sheriff, you'd be in jail right now. I'll loan you the money. Ugh, no. I can't take any more money from you, Mom. And he spent everything you ever gave me, anyway. [sighs] I'll loan you the money. But you gotta pay me back. And you gotta make this right. And we have to get you out of that trailer and away from him. He's just going through a bad time right now. Becky, the only reason I haven't busted him is, I was hoping he would come around for you. I don't think that's gonna happen. But it-it's gonna happen. I know it will. He's good inside. He goes out every day looking for work. At least I thought he did. Carl said things aren't right in that trailer. Has he ever hit you? Uh n-no, no. He's not like that. [Becky] Come on. I hope you're right. From now on, if he ever touches you or breaks the law in any way, I'm gonna bring him down. Look Becky, we know that you're a grown, married woman. But we're your parents. And we love you.

Oh, my God, Russ! Did you put a gun in this car? Damn you! What were you thinking? It was in the front seat in a box. I didn't know it was a gun! He could have killed himself! He could have killed all of us! It was by my feet, Russ. I moved it to get it out of the way. Do you think I would have put it in the backseat of the car with Ralph if I knew it was a gun? Are you a fucking moron? What is wrong with you? - [Bobby] Ma'am. - Yes? I'm with the Twin Peaks Sheriff's Department, Deputy Briggs. - [horn continues honking] - Please hand me that gun. [crying] Okay. Here. - [various horns honking] - [gun clicking] Now, I'm gonna need identification from both of you, please. [siren wails] [horn continues honking] [various horns blaring] [horns continue blaring] [distant horns honking] I was at Big Ed's Gas Farm. And you know what? I heard shots. [horns continue blaring] That kid found a gun, evidently, in the back of this van and shot through the window into the Double R. These are his parents, I think. I need IDs on both of them. Ma'am, please! I'm gonna try and stop this woman from honking her horn - and get this traffic moving. - I got it, Bobby. Please, ma'am. Ma'am, please. [horns continue blaring] Please, ma'am What are you doing? We're trying to get home! We're already late. We're late for dinner. It's way past 6:30. Why is this happening? [distant horns honking] I saw that gun go shooting out the window. Her uncle is joining us. She hasn't seen him in a very long while. We're late! We've got miles to go! Please, we have to get home! She's sick! [stammers] [low gurgling] Aah! Aah! Oh, God! [screams] [gurgling] Aah! Aah! Aah! Oh! Oh. Oh! Oh! [low gurgle] Aah! Aah! [spewing] - Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! - [horns continue honking] - [gurgling] - Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! - Aah! Aah! - [low gurgle] - [spewing] - Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! [woman] Aah! Aah! [keyboard clicking] By my reckoning, this is where we're headed. But there's no road. The road's gone. The information that Major Briggs gave got me thinking. You'll understand a lot more when I explain my map. This map is very old, but it is always current. It's-it's a living thing. [Hawk] This is where Major Briggs' station was. This is Blue Pine Mountain and a-a very revered sacred site. I think that the information that the major gave us is gonna take us here. [Frank] Looks like a campfire. What is this? It's not a campfire. It's-it's a-a fire symbol. What's that mean? It's a a type of fire. More like like modern-day electricity. Good? Depends, depends upon the intention, the intention behind the fire. The major also gave us a date, day after tomorrow. [Hawk] If you read these stars, you find that same date, and it refers you to here. What is this? [Hawk] It's corn. It's fertility. But it's-it's black, diseased or unnatural. Death. If you put these two symbols together, you get this. Black fire. Correct. We saw this on that little slip of paper we took out of Major Briggs' tube. What is this? Frank you don't ever want to know about that. Really? Really. [atmospheric music] [intercom beeps] [Lucy] I don't know why I'm even thinking about furniture. Andy and I hardly ever get home. What's up, Lucy? [Lucy] Margaret Lanterman for you on line two, Hawk. That's the one that's blinking when I hang up. [line clicks] Hello, Margaret. [Margaret] Hawk? Can you hear me? Yes, Margaret. Hawk, can you hear me? Yes, Margaret. You found something, didn't you? It's just like you said. I'm sorry, I-I should have let you know. What did you find, Hawk? Margaret, I can't tell you that. My log is afraid of fire. There's fire where you are going. Hawk, there's fire where you are going. Okay, Margaret. Good night, Hawk. Good night. And thank you, Margaret. [line clicks] [dial tone hums] [button clicks] [knock at door] What is it, Jesse? Sheriff Truman, are you interested in seeing my new car? - It's a two-thousand - Jesse. I'm in a meeting. Can I look at your new car tomorrow? Okay. Thank you, Sh-Sheriff Truman. [Gordon] Cat on a hot tin roof. It's never done that before. We're supposed to get some coffee, but I don't think that's a good idea. Coffee? I would like some coffee. Maybe some warm milk. For the cat. On the roof? Yes. The picture you took of Ruth. [Gordon] I would like to see it, Albert. [mouthing words] Can I smoke in here? Smoke? Ask Macklay when he gets back. But smoking's bad for you. I know. Fuck you, Albert. That's right. Fuck you, Albert. What place do those coordinates represent? Well, the last few digits are smudged, but the numbers indicate a small town in the north Ah. The policeman's dream. Thank you, Detective Macklay. You're welcome. Hey, can I smoke in here? No, there's no smoking allowed. Detective Macklay, you know how good a cigarette would taste with this coffee? Smoke 'em if you got 'em. [exhales] Thank you. [Dave] So no suspects were found in the area. It's a positive ID on Ruth Davenport. I don't suppose you found Major Briggs' head anywhere. [Dave] We looked. There's no trace. Nobody heard anything. No shots. A bullet didn't do that to Hastings. Yeah, they're still cleaning the vehicle. We saw somebody, Albert and I, out back, out back where we found Ruth Davenport's body. What'd he look like? He looked like a homeless man, uh old clothes, beard, wool cap. I think I saw somebody like that getting out of the police car. [chair creaks] Uh, I-I could be mistaken. Well, I was in the car. I-I didn't see anybody. I didn't see anyone either. Well, I-I said I wasn't sure. Now I remember. I saw them in a room. I saw the bearded men, the same type Albert and I saw. Dirty, bearded men in a room. [intercom beeps] Dougie, come into my office, please. [Phil] Mr. Mullins, Phil Bisby here. I got your coffee and we'll be right in. Good. All right, Mr. Mullins, here's your coffee, sir. - [Bushnell] Thank you, Phil. - [Phil] You're welcome. [Bushnell] Sit down, Dougie. Just close the door behind you when you go, Phil. Yes, sir. Dougie, now that I've had time to think about this, it's clear that your investigative work has exposed a ring of organized crime and possible police corruption flowing through this office. The recent two attempts on your life, the blowing up your car, the man trying to shoot you, absolutely confirm this. Also, thanks to you, we now know that the Mitchum brothers' case was not arson but a legitimate claim for an accidental fire, which indicates to me that the Mitchum brothers, although alleged gangsters, are not part of this conspiracy, which suggests that the shots are being called by somebody else. Somebody else. I think you're right, Dougie. And this is interesting. The Mitchums just called me, wanting to have a personal sit-down with you. [laughs] Now, normally, I wouldn't put one of my agents into the ring with guys like this, but since you uncovered and righted the wrong on their behalf, they are gonna be ecstatic when you deliver to them this 30-million-dollar check. [laughs] I know what you're thinking. You're thinking, A 30-million-dollar payout for a firm our size, that has to be catastrophic, right? [chuckles] [muffled] Catastrophic, right. But Battling Bud always punched above his weight class. I took out a secondary policy to cover our play on this one, which, because it was truly was an accident, will cover our potential loss and then some. Bushnell double down. [mumbling] Bushnell double down. Nobody keeps Battling Bud on the ropes for long. They want to see you at 5:30. They're sending a car. [slurping] [muffled pipes flushing] He's just coming out of the bathroom now. [door opens] [door shuts] [exhales] [exhales] All right Rodney. I had a dream. Did ya? Had it all fuckin' night. I dreamt about killing that Douglas Jones fuck. I just hate him so bad. I can't wait to kill this guy. Can you last three more hours? Barely. [exhales] I can't eat this. [exhales] - [elevator dings] - [indistinct chatter] [electric guitar strums] [atmospheric music] Dougie, it's 5:30. Where are you going? [indistinct chatter] You've got the check, don't you? - Yeah, you're all set. - [patting chest] Where you taking him? Santino's. Oh, you're gonna like that. I'm in your corner, champ. Knock 'em dead. Dead. [exhales softly] [Dougie grunts softly] [Al strains] - [door opens] - [ignition beeping] Red door. [laughs] Yeah.

And if that something is what I saw in my dream, we can't kill him. What the fuck are you talking No, I'm not kidding, Rodney. If he's got this one certain thing that's in that box, it means we can't kill him. Why? It means he's not our enemy, Rodney. How the fuck can you know that? I-I'm just telling you what was in the dream. But it's gotta be this one certain thing. What? Rodney, it's a million-in-one shot, but if it's in there, you got You gotta promise me. Listen to me.

s1e1,"Gone fishing.
The lonesome foghorn blows.
Oh, dear.
Lucy? Lucy, this is Pete Martell.
Lucy, put Harry on the horn.
Sheriff, it's Pete Martell up at the mill.
Um, I'm gonna transfer it to the phone on the table by the red chair.
The red chair against the wall.
The little table with the lamp on it.
The lamp that we moved from the corner."
s1e2,"Diane, 6:18 a.m, Room 315.
Great Northern Hotel up here in Twin Peaks.
Slept pretty well.
Non-smoking room.
There's no tobacco smell.
That's a nice consideration for the business traveler.
A hint of Douglas fir needles in the air.
As Sheriff Truman indicated they would, everything this hotel promised, they've delivered.
Clean, reasonably priced accommodations.
Telephone works."
s1e3,"Previously We'll talk later.
Albert, if you come up to Lewis Fork, I can recommend a place for lunch.
- Leo called you? - He asked for the rest of the money.
She was supposed to hand it over today.
She checked out on us.
We're lucky we're in jail.
You know what's gonna go down with Leo when we get out.
No! No! No, no, no, not in my room.
In here, in here! - Jerry, back from Paris? - Ben, what a nightmare! Right there! No, right there.
What is with you guys? I've got a sandwich in there, I want all those bags open."
s1e4,"Diane, 7:15 a.m.
I'll be heading to the sheriff's after breakfast.
From there, we'll be going on to Laura Palmer's funeral.
Good morning, Colonel Cooper.
Just ""agent,"" Audrey.
Special agent.
Special agent.
Would you care to join me for breakfast? - I'm in a hurry.
- For what? Audrey, that perfume you're wearing is incredible.
- Do you really think so? - Yes, I do."
s1e5," Previously on ""Twin Peaks"" Agent Cooper.
There's no sign of the man with one arm.
Keep trying.
He's out there.
If anyone can find him, Hawk can.
- He's a tracker? - The best.
My darling daughter Jade.
Uncle Leland? Madeleine? Blood? Somebody's running drugs into Twin Peaks.
- Who's targeted? - Jacques Renault.
Bartender at the Roadhouse."
s1e6,"Diane, it is 4:28 a.m.
I have just been woken up by the most God-awful racket, which you can probably hear over the sound of my voice.
Can you hear that? Up until this moment, I've experienced nothing at the Great Northern Hotel but the most pleasant, courteous service imaginable.
However, it just goes to prove the point that once a traveler leaves his home, he loses almost 100 percent of his ability to control his environment.
Diane, I was wondering if you could overnight express to me two pair of those Ear-Pillow silicone earplugs which I used on my last trip to New York.
Naturally, I didn't bring them with me on this trip, because I didn't feel it would be necessary.
However Coffee? Please.
- What's with the choir practice? - Heh.
Business junket.
From Iceland."
s1e7," Previously on ""Twin Peaks"" You 'll put me to work behind the perfume counter.
Does that clear things up? So where do I start? Washing dishes will be fine.
Donna, it's Maddy.
I found a tape in her hiding place.
I'll meet you and James tomorrow, and bring a tape recorder.
Why would an apartment dweller like Jacques buy so much heating oil? To heat a log cabin.
- What did you see that night? - Two men, two girls.
Screams.
We'll give Josie a chance to sell, tomorrow.
You do realise the risk if anyone sees us."
s1e8,"Previously on ""Twin Peaks"" I shot him, Bobby.
I know I did.
- What happened? - Somebody shot Waldo.
Leo, no! Leo, no! This was hidden in the desk.
- Then we can proceed.
- Is it set for tonight? Yes - What policy is this? - Your new life insurance.
Are you suggesting that there's something irregular at work here? - Rejected, that's what he said.
- Nadine, don't you give up.
Sign here.
Welcome to One-Eyed Jacks, Hester."

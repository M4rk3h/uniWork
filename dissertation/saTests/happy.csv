5,"Im singing this song, its time it was sung
Ive been putting it off for a while,
But its harder by now, cause the truth is so clear
That I cry when Im seeing you smile.
So goodbye, so long, the road calls me dear
And your tears cannot bind me anymore,
And farewell to the girl with the sun in her eyes
Can I kiss you, and then Ill be gone.

Every time that I tried to tell that wed lost the magic we had at the start,
I would weep my heart when I looked in your eyes
And I searched once again for the spark.
So goodbye, so long, the road calls me dear
And your tears cannot bind me anymore,
And farewell to the girl with the sun in her eyes
Can I kiss you, and then Ill be gone.

I can see by your eyes, its time now to go
So Ill leave you to cry in the rain,
Though I held in my hand, the key to all joy
Honey my heart was not born to be tamed.
So goodbye, so long, the road calls me dear
And your tears cannot bind me anymore,
And farewell to the girl with the sun in her eyes
Can I kiss you, and then Ill be gone.

So goodbye, so long, the road calls me dear
And your tears cannot bind me anymore,
And farewell to the girl with the sun in her eyes
Can I kiss you, and then Ill be gone.
Can I kiss you, and then Ill be gone, can I kiss you, and then Ill be gone."

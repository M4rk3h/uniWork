2018,2018-1,"At first, the simulation seemed like a really tough exercise to me. Managing a crisis requires a lot of patience and reflection. I was then really stressed during the first meeting. When we assigned the roles, I was nervous and discussed with my classmates to understand better what I had to do. The first meeting was really helpful, indeed we got to know each other and by that gain confidence in our project and team. By that I could also understand each members’ personality leading me to know how they deal with stress and what kind of work methods they use. After the first meeting, I already felt more confident and encouraged to get a good grade on this exam. The second meeting was even more helpful. The second time we met helped everyone reassure himself/herself in that we could do it. The more prepared we were getting the less stressed we felt. I really had a feeling of confidence and preparation at the end of the meeting leading me to believe that everybody was ready for the simulation the next morning. We were all aware of each other’s strengths, which reinforced the group’s relations. The day of the simulation was obviously a little stressful. It is at the end an exam. When we got into the simulation room I was also a little scared by the reality of the simulation, meaning that all the room was prepared and looked so professional strengthening the fact the exam was real. But as soon as the countdown went on the screen and the case appeared I was relieved. Indeed, I knew the case, I had heard about the crisis and knew the facts and issues that we were going to deal with.","At first, the simulation seemed like a really tough exercise to me.

2018,2018-2,"As we did not choose the people we work with before the simulation, I was feeling anxious that there may be some difficulties during the work process. Before experiencing it, the idea of the crisis simulation was threatening to me as I was thinking of the mistakes that could occur under pressure. I was concerned for one of our team members, due to his lack of communication during the preparation process, which made me feel stressed on the day before the simulation. In the beginning of the simulation I was worried and was thinking about all the possible questions I could be asked. During the first call, I organized my thoughts and started feeling calmer, which helped me to be more confident during the second call. After the simulation and the comments of the journalist, I felt more at ease. I originally felt that this experience wouldn’t be a good one, as I found that my team were not as serious as I was. I realized that the feedback after the simulation and evaluation are critical and very important for identifying positive outcomes from such experiences and could build essential skills for my future development.","As we did not choose the people we work with before the simulation, I was feeling anxious that there may be some difficulties during the work process.

2018,2018-3,"Prior the crisis simulation I felt motivated to do a good job with my team. I was positive minded because I knew that we were going to work efficiently together. The fact that we all share the pursuit of achieving a distinction grade, it made the commitment and hard work equal and competitive for everyone. However, my biggest concern was to not stay calm and serene dealing with the phone call complaints; specifically, going blank with the English language was my main worry. The day of the assignment I was not feeling myself due to health problems and my mind focus was not exactly like I wanted it to be. However, I tried my best in the spontaneity of the moment. Each member had their own roles but we were all working collectively to support each member if needed. I found myself trying to help everyone in every task and share my ideas about good responses to social media and press release, besides my own task. I had a good attitude to stay calm with the team and felt that I shared a good contribution to the overall development of the tasks. I made sure every member was enjoying the simulation by giving feedback, asking about how they were feeling and giving encouraging feedback via voicing that we were on track to achieving our target. Frustration at one point was felt as I noticed when conveying my message across that little attention was being paid from my colleagues. During the phone call, I felt that I started with a positive and decisive attitude but as the situation became more intense and challenging, my biggest concern occurred. I went blank a couple of times and my answers to some attacking statements were weak. I felt my English skills in that moment could not process the solid and developed responses I know I can do, but being under pressure in that situation made it more challenging. Overall, I believe multiple positives can be pointed with my team as; I managed to maintain a professional attitude, following the same steps alike to what was practiced in class simulation tasks and in the previous meetings with my team. Although I believe the feedback received from the PR practitioner was severe, I am holding a receptive attitude to improve my learning on how to adopt a serene attitude under pressure, as well as working on my communication skills; and gain incentive to become acquainted of different techniques to improve leadership skills and 'be heard'.","Prior the crisis simulation I felt motivated to do a good job with my team.

2018,2018-4,"The meetings before the simulation helped us a lot, indeed we felt more comfortable with each other, we also gained confidence and less stress. But during the simulation, I felt a little stressed due to the timing, I was afraid that we could not respect that, but this stress went away thanks to the group’s cohesion and our previous meetings. After that, I was very focused because we had only two hours, so I needed to be efficient. The simulation case was really interesting we had a lot to do and we did it on time, and I was very impressed because everything seemed real, the phone call, the document printed on time for each task to do and also the information broadcast one the TV, so I really felt like it was a real situation and that we have been working for the real company as a Team Manager. When the situation ended, I thought “It is already the end?”, the two hours passed very quickly, and seemed to me only few minutes and I wanted to continue it. With my team we were very satisfied with the work we provided all together and how we handle and respond to the crisis. If I had to do it again, I will do it gladly with the same group.","The meetings before the simulation helped us a lot, indeed we felt more comfortable with each other, we also gained confidence and less stress.","But during the simulation, I felt a little stressed due to the timing, I was afraid that we could not respect that, but this stress went away thanks to the group’s cohesion and our previous meetings.

2018,2018-5,"Several feelings came to me since the time I knew about the crisis simulation until the end of the crisis. First, I was a little bit stress about the fact I will be in group with people I don’t know and working with them on a crisis simulation. Then, when I met them, they make me confident because we were all organize together, and we defined well our jobs in this situation. Plus, most of the team members were Welsh, so they told me that if I needed help they were here for me because they knew that English was not my mother tong, it helped me being more confident about the crisis. During the crisis simulation I was anxious because I didn’t expect it will be like this but then I just calm myself and just telling me to focus on my job. The more the minutes passed, the more I was confident in what I was doing. Indeed, we were helping each other’s because the information’s came out but not all at the same time. For example, you helped someone else when you didn’t have a mission in the task and vice versa. This made me more comfortable than at the beginning because everybody was helping and bringing thoughts to the work. The time did not seem very long because the events happened very quickly, and I was really focus and concerning with the situation. That’s why I liked the situation because it made me involved on it and I tried to resolve the problem as much as I can. At the middle of the simulation I was a little bit tired because of all the events, indeed, the more the minutes went by, the more the situation was getting worse. At the end of the simulation, I felt released from the pressure and I felt like I did my job well.","Several feelings came to me since the time I knew about the crisis simulation until the end of the crisis.

2018,2018-6,"When my lecturer informed me that I was required to work in a team and respond to a real PR crisis, I became slightly sceptical since I generally prefer individual work. However, when I discovered that I was going to be placed in teams based on my mark for the first assignment, I felt more relieved as I considered it beneficial to work with people who were on the same level as I was. At the same time, the fact that I had the opportunity to practise each of the tasks in mock simulations within class made me feel less stressed and more confident about the crisis simulation. After I had met my teammates, I felt that they were very open-minded and sociable which facilitated our level of communication and cooperation within the team. Even so, before the examination occurred, I thought that my group showed reluctance to being the spokesperson. Although I was quite content with the role I received (social media) and relaxed when one of my teammates offered to be the spokesperson, I felt that I should have volunteered to be one in charge of the telephone calls instead as that would have challenged me to become more comfortable to speaking to people on the phone. During the day of the crisis simulation, I felt extremely anxious because I had never experienced anything like that before and the fact that I knew I would be monitored by various PR professionals and practitioners made the situation even more stressful for me. In addition, due to the examination day running behind schedule, I was not called for the examination on time which made me feel tenser. Despite everything, all my emotions and anxiety had vanished once I was sat in the room with my teammates, completing the tasks I received. I started to feel more confident as I had managed to express most of my ideas to my teammates mainly because everyone displayed positive attitudes and energy. However, I also felt like my suggestions have not been entirely heard or understood at times due to my nervousness. After the crisis simulation ended, I felt relaxed and I thought the experience overall was overwhelming and for the very first time I enjoyed working in a team. The positive feedback that my team received from the supervisor made me reconsider my performance on the examination as I initially felt worried about my performance.","When my lecturer informed me that I was required to work in a team and respond to a real PR crisis, I became slightly sceptical since I generally prefer individual work.

2018,2018-7,"Before the crisis simulation i felt a little bit stressed, but when i talked with my team i realised that i had nothing to worry about. During the crisis simulation i felt confident and comfortable with my team. I felt that there were no wrong answer. At the begining i was expecting from members of my team to lead the simulation and to tell me what i had to do, but i quickly understood that it was up to me to assign myself something to do. So as soon as the different information about the festival came and we split the articles between every members i had the feeling that my team trusted me to point out the relevant informations. Then the more the simulation went by the more confident i felt and eventually i was totaly comfortable. During the crisis simulation one of my main preocupation was to check out the time. I was stressed to run out of time without finishing the task, but i realised that the time alloted was enough to analyse and and solve the problems. Also, at the begining of the crisis i felt myself slow compared to some of my team mates, because when the crisis simulation started they were instantly ready and started to give solution. Whereas me, i needed a little bit more time to analyse, point out key elements and resolve the problem. However, once i was totally confident and on a roll i felt totally in harmony with my team. After the crisis simulation i realised how insurmountable it was not, but above all i felt happy to be done with that.","Before the crisis simulation i felt a little bit stressed, but when i talked with my team i realised that i had nothing to worry about.

2018,2018-8,"As the simulation lasts 2 hours, we had to control the time. This lack of time was very stressful as we had to take into account the count down. It was difficult for me to focus without thinking about the minutes. The time is the most frustrating point in the simulation. Furthermore, the fact that someone is in the room with us, observing our work is very stressful at the beginning, then, after we were very focused on the simulation, I didn’t think about it anymore, I was only thinking about the missions we had to achieve. During the crisis simulation, I was only thinking about each of the tasks we had to do. I was always trying to search for the right way of saying something without customers and media taking it the wrong way. Furthermore, even if we met several times before with my team, we didn’t know each other so we didn’t know all of our reactions, but we handled it very good in my opinion. I appreciated the fact that we were always communicating and sharing our thoughts as the simulation was going on, it really helped us move forward and deliver our best. When it was written on the TV, that the simulation was done, we were all impressed and we all looked at each other, impressed we were here for already 2 hours and that the simulation was done. After the simulation ended, I have thought about what we could have done better, what we did wrong and how. I was reassuring when the supervisor told us the way we handled the situation was very good. It proved me we did a good team work.",the,"As the simulation lasts 2 hours, we had to control the time.

2018,2018-9,"When the professor mentioned the PR Crisis Simulation in the beginning of the course, I felt very interested about it; I founded enthralling the fact of being working at something which combines improvisation and team work. Moreover, I thought that it would be a funny and very useful experience. The previous days, however, I felt I was not prepared enough, even though I had met with my team many times and we had planned what we were going to do, but the preparation did not take as much time as I expected. However, at the same time I thought that it would be fine and that we will do it good because we had agreed everything in the meetings. During the experience, I felt more confident than I expected. Everything was going on more or less as planned: we worked well as a team and I did not feel we lost control at any time during the crisis. I enjoyed the simulation most of the time. After the simulation I felt really good. I had the feeling of having done a good job and having worked well with my team. What I had prepared was useful during the simulation.","When the professor mentioned the PR Crisis Simulation in the beginning of the course, I felt very interested about it; I founded enthralling the fact of being working at something which combines improvisation and team work.

2018,2018-10,"Before the PR crisis simulation I was not stressed because I felt confident with my role. The preparation during the tutorials and the meetings with my team give us the opportunity to planned how to work as a team and make sure that we’ll coordinate our work well. During the simulation, I was a bit worried by the timer but as we planned we helped each other in each task so it helped a lot. It was a bit hard and confusing to start but thanks to the two managers, we found the motivation and the good stress to work efficiently. Before the simulation the others were quite stressed because no one knew the subject of the crisis and they were a bit scared to be surprise by the tasks. During the crisis they were also comfortable in helping everyone so they were less stressed when they had to deal with their assigned task. Plus, everyone was thankful to the entire team when it comes to bring other ideas and opinions to improve our work. So, our team plan reassured everyone. After the crisis I didn’t really know how to feel because I couldn’t be certain of the success of the crisis simulation, even after the analysis of the simulation, but I felt really proud of us and our teamwork. Me and my team have quite the same opinion about the simulation, which is important in our module so we can realize the seriousness of a crisis, the stress made by it and also the importance of the time in dealing with a crisis, to respond, to react, etc. It is also an opportunity to evaluate our own knowledge and capacity to deal with a crisis as it was real.","Before the PR crisis simulation I was not stressed because I felt confident with my role.

2018,2018-11,"I felt very apprehensive and fearful beforehand. I felt this was down to the fact that I did not know anyone in my team. Due to this I thought it would be more difficult to form a cohesive team as I did not know individuals’ strengths and weaknesses, meaning it would be more challenging when assigning individuals roles. I thought the Crisis Simulation went smoother than I anticipated. Initially I thought we would be committed to the roles we were assigned to. But, as the tasks were set I found that we worked much more efficiently when we were all communicating amongst each other and assisting each other’s’ roles. I think this happened naturally as not all roles needed to be working at the same time. My role was to respond to the media via phone. However, I was assigned this role as I was the only individual who spoke English as a first language. I felt an added pressure as my colleagues expected me to fulfil this role. I did not want this role as I was not confident to communicate professionally to the media. I felt pleased with my overall performance, and I also feel that I took over other peoples’ roles who did not communicate much. I felt as a team we operated well, but more communication from some individuals could have resulted in more detailed responses. We ran out of time on a couple of tasks, but I felt this was unfair as we were told it was a 2 hour simulation, however we were in there for 1 hour 40 minutes.","I felt very apprehensive and fearful beforehand.

2018,2018-12,"My emotional state before the simulation was mixed of positive and negative feelings. In the beginning our group did not manage to meet which was disappointing to me because I had high expectations for myself on this assignment. Right before the assignment I was more positive due to most of the team members engaging in the subject. We assigned our roles in advance, so everyone had the chance to prepare himself for his task in depth, and I had a good feeling with my social media role. My thoughts were calm before and during the simulation, because once started you cannot change anything than giving your best. Afterwards I was happy how we managed the task and it went much faster than I expected. Nonetheless, I already had some points in my head we could have done better, so I was a little bit disappointed that I have not thought of it some minutes before.","My emotional state before the simulation was mixed of positive and negative feelings.

2018,2018-13,"I have always had some confidence problems but I have always been able to give my opinion on what is going on and the decisions to make. Before entering the room I was very stressed by what was going to happen, I apprehend the subject. During the crisis simulation I had to face several emotions, from joy to sadness. When the crisis started I was determined to make sure that I could stop it and that there was good cohesion in our group in order to facilitate the exchange of information as much as possible. During the first part, I had difficulties but I managed to share my information with others. I was embarrassed to take more time to express myself and to give them my information while they did it in a very fast way. I had to show courage to communicate in imperfect English because I wanted to get involved. In the second part we all had the same information. I felt a little useless in front of the speed of the decisions taken by the group. As the crisis continued I felt less and less at my place in the group. I understood absolutely everything but it was as if I had given up because I was afraid not to be able to express myself as quickly as the group wanted and to disappoint them. I reflected on the experience and my feelings during the crisis. I realized that it was normal to feel nervous and stressed because that was the goal. It's a natural reaction, but it hasn't been beneficial to me. Nevertheless, I am happy to have experienced this event because it allowed me to participate in the management of a crisis.","I have always had some confidence problems but I have always been able to give my opinion on what is going on and the decisions to make. Before entering the room I was very stressed by what was going to happen, I apprehend the subject.","During the crisis simulation I had to face several emotions, from joy to sadness. When the crisis started I was determined to make sure that I could stop it and that there was good cohesion in our group in order to facilitate the exchange of information as much as possible. During the first part, I had difficulties but I managed to share my information with others. I was embarrassed to take more time to express myself and to give them my information while they did it in a very fast way. I had to show courage to communicate in imperfect English because I wanted to get involved. In the second part we all had the same information. I felt a little useless in front of the speed of the decisions taken by the group. As the crisis continued I felt less and less at my place in the group.

2018,2018-14,"Before the simulation, I felt confident, a bit stressed and excited. However, considering that 4 out of 6 people in my team were French people, another one was a Chinese girl and only one Welsh boy was in my team, I was worried about the quality of our comprehension, communication and writing of the tasks of the simulation. I expected the simulation to be less difficult. The PR crisis that Fyre Festival has was a huge one, which was difficult to handle. During the simulation, I felt stressed because I was the one typing on the computer, so I had to listen to my team members, and type as fast as possible on a keyboard different than the French one. The time was going really fast and we didn't have a lot of time to accomplish the tasks so it was stressful. However, thanks to the teamwork of my team members, their trust in me, happiness, ideas and advices, I felt confident again and did my best to accomplish the tasks. Sam has reassured me because I was always asking him to proofread what I was typing, and he has always given me good advices to reformulate the sentences the other team members and I were thinking of. I felt like we were a real communication team and that our festival really had a PR crisis. I forgot that the woman who was taking notes about our simulation was in the same room as us because I was really concerned about and focused on the work we had to do. Afterwards, I felt proud of myself and enriched by this experience because the simulation improved both my knowledges in PR and my teamwork skills. Some of my team members were also proud of me and thanked me for my work, which really pleased me and made me realize that I did a good job. I felt also proud of them and was glad to meet some of them and get to know better the ones I already knew.","Before the simulation, I felt confident, a bit stressed and excited.

2018,2018-15,"In spite of the successive simulations of crises carried out throughout the course, this was the first time that we had to face a more strict simulation. Before starting, I felt some fear and curiosity about whether my knowledge about public relations and my command of the English language would be enough to contribute to my team's work in achieving the crisis. That is why my initial feelings were characterized by a certain insecurity and nervousness. All this was accompanied by a high pressure derived from the great speed with which we had to respond to messages on social networks and carry out the writing of the various communications. In addition, although I find it hard to recognize, I did not feel completely comfortable during the crisis simulation with my role within the group. This is due to the fact that the roles that we had defined at the beginning of the crisis, in my opinion, were not respected, causing my perception of the value of my contributions to be very low, sometimes feeling somewhat undervalued and lost as to how I could help to the work group. To finish this section, at the end of the simulation, I felt that I had not enjoyed the experience as much as I would have liked, causing my own vision about my actions not to be good enough.","In spite of the successive simulations of crises carried out throughout the course, this was the first time that we had to face a more strict simulation.

2018,2018-16,"Before the simulation took place, I felt quite confident of my group. This is because we were in roles that we were most comfortable and confident in. I felt that I could trust my group, but also if a problem arose, other group members would be able to assist me. However, I did feel quite anxious and nervous leading up to simulation. During the simulation, I was feeling anxious and quite nervous throughout the experience. I had full trust within my group during each of their tasks however, I was doubting my confidence in my own ability. This resulted in myself needing the assistance of Laura as she was the computer typist. After each of the tasks, I felt happy and confident in the work that the group was producing. Once the simulation had completed, I felt very happy with our performance and I personally felt confident that as a group, we had achieved the grade that we were aiming for. However, when receiving our feedback from the practitioner, I felt extremely deflated, worried and disappointed. Speaking with my group, they also had similar feelings. These negative feelings arose due to comments the practitioner had stated, some of which I felt were assumptive and overly critical. An example of one of the negative comments was, at the beginning of the simulation as we received the news articles, the practitioner advised that the group should have spoken to one another whilst reading instead of communicating afterwards. I personally felt that this comment is unwarranted, as Sian has a disability that requires silence whilst reading to concentrate. As a group, we also read in silence because, both Celine and Clotilde have English as their second language, meaning it is more difficult to understand the news articles. So, as a group we wanted to make Sian, Celine and Clotilde feel as comfortable as possible. Another example of the observations that I felt was unwarranted was that, the press release should have been more adequately prepared with notes. As this was my role, I felt extremely annoyed by this comment as I had organised my tasks. However, I believe the practitioner jumped to an assumption as my notes did not have the title “press release”. Conversely, there were some critiques that I agreed with such as the use of the contact number and the formality of our communications. The practitioner’s overall final comment was that we carried out an “okay job”. This comment made me feel as though I had failed the simulation and that this grade could severely detriment my final degree classification.","Before the simulation took place, I felt quite confident of my group.

2018,2018-17,"Due to the good tutorials and the group meetings we arranged, I went with confidence, pleasant anticipation and excitement into the simulation. After receiving the topic of the crisis I got even more thrilled because I visit music festivals myself regularly. That made it easier for me to put myself in the situation´s shoes. The excitement held well over the first two tasks and went along with slight tension and stress when the third and fourth tasks were announced. Unsure about whether the responses should be general or individual, the inner unrest that was created was enhanced by the timer. However, these feelings vanished after a few moments by courtesy of good solution options during a short brainstorming session with the other members. After processing the fifth task my mind and body were exhausted. This condition influenced my mood negatively when a further task popped up. Nevertheless the ambition of the other members gave me an additional motivational boost. Immediately after the simulation ended, a feeling of relief started to spread. Anyway I was grateful for this “real-life-experience”.","Due to the good tutorials and the group meetings we arranged, I went with confidence, pleasant anticipation and excitement into the simulation.","After receiving the topic of the crisis I got even more thrilled because I visit music festivals myself regularly.

I had some fears, such as misunderstanding the subject, partially answering the job or not finishing the tasks in the allotted time. However, the members of my group quickly reassured me because we were well prepared and everyone knew what they had to do. I was immediately reassured about my fears during the crisis situation. We put our knowledge into practice and used our previous training. We expected what was asked of us and there were no unpleasant surprises. Nevertheless, I have some regrets regarding my personal work; I would have liked to be able to understand the whole subject quickly and then participate more in the exchanges. Indeed, my level of English penalized me a little in regard to my understanding and ability to communicate. I took a little more time than the other students to read the documents and understand the context of the crisis. Subsequently, I had difficulty intervening in the debates and putting across my views. As my English was not as good as the other students, I was afraid I may not find the right words to express myself and to find my place in the group. Nevertheless, they came to me, so that I could give my opinion and really participate in the group work.

There was a bit of anxiety because you had to give the best of yourself. I was worried about the kind of crisis we were going to face. During the crisis simulation, I relaxed. Indeed, the case was interesting because, being young, we are often interested in festivals. Moreover, this case was a bit similar to another case we had seen in class. It gave me confidence and I knew what I had to do. During the different steps, I tried to give a maximum of ideas but I was not always sure if it was correct. But my team listened to my ideas and then we changed together to be closer to our crisis.

During the simulation, the main factor of pressure was the time which was running and the quasi-impossibility to go back on previous tasks. However, I did not really have time to think about that since the simulation required to quickly reflect and react to the ongoing flow of information.

I was confident about what I had to do, and I was already constructing sentences in my head suitable for the Press Release. As the tasks were given to us one by one and not, as we had expected it, several tasks at once, we all tried to help each other which led to everyone speaking simultaneously.

During the simulation, I felt a number of things: worry and slight panic when the start of the simulation was delayed as I was not sure if me and the team were at the right place and missing the simulation, however that all went away once we were in the pod room. I gained further confidence from seeing that the mock simulation was very similar to the simulation on the day. I felt very satisfied, confident and happy once it was over as I felt like we did a good job and I contributed towards that result.","During the preparations for the crisis I was calm but curious about how and what exactly is going to happen.

2018,2018-28,"Before being given the tasks I felt extremely confident as I already knew about the crisis as I was following The Fyre Festival and saw everything unfold live in 2017. I felt confident within myself being the manager of the team, but I was not as confident in my group. Once the first task was revealed, I found that everyone relied on me, this is fine as I was the manager, but to a certain extent I believe others in my group should have helped and put input in instead of purely relying on myself. A few tasks I had to compose myself and really think of the best scenario as I was feeling pressured by my group to think for everyone else. I felt confident within the tasks while also feeling extreme pressure. I thought at the time that each of the tasks were relevant and allowed each member of the group to show their knowledge to the best of each individuals’ ability. Once the simulation was over I was happy, this changed after receiving the initial feedback as I do not believe we as a group performed as great as expected and hoped. Afterwards, I felt disappointed in myself as I believe I could have done better.","Before being given the tasks I felt extremely confident as I already knew about the crisis as I was following The Fyre Festival and saw everything unfold live in 2017.

But the mock simulation, which we could practise in the tutorials, made me feel more comfortable with regard to the exam. After I did a lot of research, especially for the press release and about former crisis, I was positive that my group and I will perform well. On the day of the crisis simulation and right before it started, I was a little nervous but still optimistic. During the simulation the tension dropped off and I got used to the situation. However, in the beginning, I started to get stressed as my group could not split up the tasks as planned. This made it unstructured but then we managed to work well together. Straight after the simulation I felt that I could have done better. It was hard for me to estimate the quality of my performance. Even though I was satisfied with the teamwork of my team and the overall situation. After the feedback, my estimation was overall positive. The observer reassured us about our great team work, a good time management and that we handled the situation very well. She mentioned that she liked how I conferred with Alex about his second phone call. Furthermore I found her feedback really useful and a good basis for improvements for such situations in the future.","As I have never done a crisis simulation before, I was unsure about how to prepare for it.

I was also apprehensive as I was a little bit unsure of exactly what the simulation would entail and in what volume the tasks would come through. However, whilst feeling nervous I also felt rather confident in our team as after meeting up as a group before the simulation I felt we would work together well as a team. I was also confident as I felt that every member in the team was aware of their role and would be capable to complete their roles well. During the crisis simulation I felt happy that every member of the team was trying their best in order to complete every task set. I also felt enjoyment during the completion of the task as I felt it was a good way to test skills learnt previously in the module and could therefore relax as I was enjoying completing the tasks.

2018,2018-33,"During the exercise I personally felt very calm. Our course tutor had set up practice simulations where we could hone our skills learnt in class and use them in real life PR crises. With the practice prior to the actual simulation, I had a clear vision of what needed to be done, how to address certain situations and the do’s and don’ts when running the simulation. A very clear ‘don’t’ was not to hang up the phone before the practitioner has finished the phone conversation. I understand that this is a trivial and somewhat common-sense practice not to do but in previous simulations this happens and as a result, their grade was jeopardised. As I had a clear understanding of what needed to be achieved in an attempt to dissolve the crisis, I immediately started writing key points on the whiteboards with positive and negative sides to the crisis such as confirmed bookings, confirmed flights home and payment to the bands. This was used as a reassurance tactic so that if anyone in the team got stuck on a task, they could refer to the board for guidance. My thoughts during the simulation were good, I am an extrovert, I am happy to lead teams even if I am not completely confident myself. I believe my strong persona was the catalyst to a relaxed team that lead our team to success.",the,"During the exercise I personally felt very calm.

Once in the room, we focused right away. At the beginning of the examination, when we received our paper, we did as we practiced, we shared the different papers and sat in silence in order to comprehend and take notes and then gather the information we all understood. We did so, because Sian suffers with dyspraxia and fibromyalgia which affects her capability of listening to everyone and being able to read at the same time, she made us aware of that at our very first meeting and we had decided collectively to agree on reading in silence at the beginning and make notes. Also, this was practiced during university tutorials and was not expressed to us as a negative way of starting the simulation. Furthermore, regarding the simulation in itself, I do not feel like we panicked at all, we were relaxed and confident about what we were doing. I think that this made me really confident and ensured that I would not feel stressed for any reason. We all knew that if someone felt in difficulty, as a team we should help each other as much as we could to gain time and efficiency.

The fact that the room was small made me comfortable because if felt like a real-life situation at work. However, I was hesitant regarding the fact that an examiner was sitting in the same room. Once in the room, we focused right away. ","At the beginning of the examination, when we received our paper, we did as we practiced, we shared the different papers and sat in silence in order to comprehend and take notes and then gather the information we all understood. We did so, because Sian suffers with dyspraxia and fibromyalgia which affects her capability of listening to everyone and being able to read at the same time, she made us aware of that at our very first meeting and we had decided collectively to agree on reading in silence at the beginning and make notes. Also, this was practiced during university tutorials and was not expressed to us as a negative way of starting the simulation. Furthermore, regarding the simulation in itself, I do not feel like we panicked at all, we were relaxed and confident about what we were doing. I think that this made me really confident and ensured that I would not feel stressed for any reason. We all knew that if someone felt in difficulty, as a team we should help each other as much as we could to gain time and efficiency. ","Finally, after the simulation we were all really excited about what we had accomplished. We thought we really did well and I really felt proud of what I had done during the evaluation. I tend to panic and I felt like I was really able to deal with the situation even under the time pressure we had. Also, I want to emphasize the fact that my team being really helpful to each other, I felt completely reassured during the simulation, as I knew that if we had any problem with English grammar for example during our social media writing, anyone would have been happy to help us."
2018,2018-42,"Prior to the stimulation I felt very nervous as although I had prepared, I did not know what to expect. I wanted to perform to the best of my ability and not let my team down. When I entered the Hydra Suite I began to feel more relaxed because I knew I had to be calm to focus on the tasks. Working under such high pressure and time constraints in this environment was a completely new experience to me and looking back I do feel like I handled myself well in this situation. I do feel that it is natural to get a little bit stressed in a situation like this, and I did but I made sure to keep this stress and panic to a minimal not to affect myself and my team’s performance. After the stimulation I felt relief from it being over after worrying about it for weeks and I also felt proud of my own, and my teams performance as I feel that we all did our best in the situation and worked well together.","Prior to the stimulation I felt very nervous as although I had prepared, I did not know what to expect.

2018,2018-43,"At first, the simulation seemed like a really tough exercise to me. Managing a crisis requires a lot of patience and reflection. I was then really stressed during the first meeting. When we assigned the roles, I was nervous and discussed with my classmates to understand better what I had to do. The first meeting was really helpful, indeed we got to know each other and by that gain confidence in our project and team. By that I could also understand each members’ personality leading me to know how they deal with stress and what kind of work methods they use. After the first meeting, I already felt more confident and encouraged to get a good grade on this exam. The second meeting was even more helpful. The second time we met helped everyone reassure himself/herself in that we could do it. The more prepared we were getting the less stressed we felt. I really had a feeling of confidence and preparation at the end of the meeting leading me to believe that everybody was ready for the simulation the next morning. We were all aware of each other’s strengths, which reinforced the group’s relations. The day of the simulation was obviously a little stressful. It is at the end an exam. When we got into the simulation room I was also a little scared by the reality of the simulation, meaning that all the room was prepared and looked so professional strengthening the fact the exam was real. But as soon as the countdown went on the screen and the case appeared I was relieved. Indeed, I knew the case, I had heard about the crisis and knew the facts and issues that we were going to deal with.","At first, the simulation seemed like a really tough exercise to me.

2018,2018-44,"Before the crisis, I developed a significant stress since I was afraid not to be able to control the situation and not to be efficient for my team on the day of the exam. Besides, even if I prepared this simulation by revising my notes but also several communication crisis strategies and responses, I did not feel prepared enough as I did not know what to expect on this day. When I arrived to the room of the simulation, surprisingly, I felt more confident of my capacities but also of my group. Thanks to the survey that we had to fill before the crisis, I realised that I believed in our capacities as a group and in the good outcome of the simulation. At the very beginning of the crisis, I felt immediately very stressed because I did not know at all the Festival and the situation. Moreover, considering this first stress, I did not feel able anymore to understand correctly the article provided, and to extract the key messages and ideas. I needed five minutes to focus again and turn my significant stress into a motivating stress. For the rest of the simulation I felt much more comfortable and able to have a global vision of what was happening. A few days after this crisis, I can say that I enjoyed taking part of this experience and I had underestimated my capacities in managing a situation and in managing my stress.","Before the crisis, I developed a significant stress since I was afraid not to be able to control the situation and not to be efficient for my team on the day of the exam.

2018,2018-45,"Before going into the simulation, I was very nervous in having never had an assessment such as this before. I was confident in my ability to react to the problems I was likely to face but was slightly worried that I might make mistakes under the pressure. I didn’t want to let the team down as I know everyone wanted to do well, along with myself. Despite these feelings I was also excited and ready for a challenge. Once the simulation was underway I was no longer nervous but felt more pressured to perform well. I was tasked with writing the Initial internal memo to staff members and the responses to social media posts. I was very conscious of time throughout the simulation as there was a time limit to complete each task. I thought the work that we were producing at the time was good, the responses were always completed on time and I though the content was mostly well written. Once the simulation was over, I felt far more stressed than when we started, because the last official statement was challenging and we were pushed for time. I felt slightly angry once we had finished the simulation as I felt there was slight conflict of interest towards the end with people talking over each other and confusing one another. Only after receiving some positive feedback was I more relaxed about the work we did.","Before going into the simulation, I was very nervous in having never had an assessment such as this before.

2018,2018-46,"For me, the Crisis Simulation supposed a lot of excitement. Since we have been discussing theory on this term, I was delighted with the idea of discovering how those terms applied in a real-life situation and to see if I was able to correctly develop them. On the one hand I was feeling nervous since it was the first time I was going to be tested on this kind of activities. On the other hand, I felt confident about the task because of the preparation we had during several weeks. The mock simulation helped me to develop a deeper understanding of what I was going to be facing on the date of the actual examination. Another factor that helped me to get more self-assured was the fact that I gathered several times with my group members. Some of them I did not have the opportunity to be introduced to them before so as well as preparing for the task we got the chance to know each other and to share feelings about the exercise.","For me, the Crisis Simulation supposed a lot of excitement.

2018,2018-47,"Before the crisis simulation had started I felt apprehensive about what was to come, and even though I had prepared specifically for how to write a press release and was confident I knew how to write one I still felt the fear of the unknown. During the task I felt uneasy and had little confidence that what we were doing as a team was working as some members started to panic and stall in their work. I felt that once the first task was completed our nerves started to ease slightly but I personally found it difficult to find relevant messages from the information given that could have been sent out on behalf of the management team, I felt that because we had panicked to begin with it was difficult to settle again properly and get into a rhythm to stick to our roles as we were trying to do every task as a team rather than trusting the other members to carry out their roles. After the crisis simulation had finished I felt a sense of relief that we had finished the tasks in the specific time frame, and from talking to the other members of the team I felt positive and reassured about our efforts, and that I had been hard on myself as I felt I was underachieving throughout the crisis simulation. Lastly, the feedback we received as a group made me feel that we had performed better than I had first thought and made me feel confident going forward.","Before the crisis simulation had started I felt apprehensive about what was to come, and even though I had prepared specifically for how to write a press release and was confident I knew how to write one I still felt the fear of the unknown.","During the task I felt uneasy and had little confidence that what we were doing as a team was working as some members started to panic and stall in their work.

2018,2018-48,"Before the simulation I was feeling quite nervous, but confident at the same time, as I think my team and I were prepared enough to confront any kind of crisis, not only because we got the change to practice at class, but also due to the meetings we had before the actual simulation. During the simulation, everything we learnt throughout this term came into place and it was all about doing a brainstorm of ideas, and collecting the key words from there to afterwards, develop the most convenient answer depending on the task being asked. As we had agreed, we all participated as a team and we all helped each other with the tasks, and that´s something that made me feel positive and optimistic throughout the whole simulation and even improved my self-confidence as I felt I could ask for any doubts or feedback on my work at any time. Afterwards, all the little insecurities I could had were gone. I think we all performed really well, we all understood that it was a team work and consequently assumed well the responsibilities belonging to each of our roles. Furthermore, I believe we all remained calmed and did a very good job as we kept in mind one of our priorities, which was to recognise our error, as Fyre Festival company, and most important, to show through the press releases and social media that we were going to take this situation as an opportunity to learn and to improve and not as a decline point for the company.","Before the simulation I was feeling quite nervous, but confident at the same time, as I think my team and I were prepared enough to confront any kind of crisis, not only because we got the change to practice at class, but also due to the meetings we had before the actual simulation.","During the simulation, everything we learnt throughout this term came into place and it was all about doing a brainstorm of ideas, and collecting the key words from there to afterwards, develop the most convenient answer depending on the task being asked.

2018,2018-50,"I felt very apprehensive in the weeks leading up to the simulation. This was not because I felt unprepared or unhappy with my team’s progress, but because of the lack of practical experience in real life PR crisis situations. My theoretical knowledge in the area has massively enhanced during this module, however, putting this into practise was a new and challenging task for me. At my anxious times, I found being part of a team helpful as we would all reassure one another. Despite these concern, I felt confident in my team’s ability and was hopeful that our efforts and preparation would reflect whilst carrying out the task and in our final grade. One of the main factors which added to my worry was the uncertainty of what the actual case study would be. To prepare as much as we could we held regular meetings and stayed in touch via a group chat where we would discuss our latest thoughts. My team were aware that proactive planning plays a crucial part in being successful before and during this exercise. We also assigned specific roles to each team member, as we believed this would result in an organised and calm environment on the day of the simulation. The day of the simulation I felt surprisingly calm, however my nerves started to kick in as we entered our pod room. Despite this, I kept a positive attitude throughout as I knew this would reflect best while I was being monitored. When we received the Frye Festival case study I felt relieved, myself and other members of the team were aware of this crisis which happened last year. There were certain parts during the exercise where I felt overwhelmed and pressured, this was mainly when we were being fed a lot of information and there were multiple tasks being implemented at once. Leaving the simulation, I felt very positive, it gave me an insight into real life PR situations and has increased my confidence incredibly.","I felt very apprehensive in the weeks leading up to the simulation.

I tried to reply the question on the phone calls as straight forward as possible, but because I had to sometimes improvise, I had to add some moments of silence to be able to think of a balanced answer that wouldn’t give away much information about the current situation, but also enough information so the reporter would be satisfied. After the assessment finished, I felt relieved, and also like the simulation had been easier than expected overall, with my expectations high on our performance.","Prior to the simulation, I felt slightly nervous, as I had never done anything like it before or similar.

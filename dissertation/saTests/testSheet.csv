2018,2018-1,"At first, the simulation seemed like a really tough exercise to me. Managing a crisis requires a lot of patience and reflection. I was then really stressed during the first meeting. When we assigned the roles, I was nervous and discussed with my classmates to understand better what I had to do. The first meeting was really helpful, indeed we got to know each other and by that gain confidence in our project and team. By that I could also understand each members’ personality leading me to know how they deal with stress and what kind of work methods they use. After the first meeting, I already felt more confident and encouraged to get a good grade on this exam. The second meeting was even more helpful. The second time we met helped everyone reassure himself/herself in that we could do it. The more prepared we were getting the less stressed we felt. I really had a feeling of confidence and preparation at the end of the meeting leading me to believe that everybody was ready for the simulation the next morning. We were all aware of each other’s strengths, which reinforced the group’s relations. The day of the simulation was obviously a little stressful. It is at the end an exam. When we got into the simulation room I was also a little scared by the reality of the simulation, meaning that all the room was prepared and looked so professional strengthening the fact the exam was real. But as soon as the countdown went on the screen and the case appeared I was relieved. Indeed, I knew the case, I had heard about the crisis and knew the facts and issues that we were going to deal with.","Well my time went so quickly, I went lickety-splickly out to my old '55
As I drove away slowly, feeling so holy, God knows, I was feeling alive.

Now the sun's coming up, I'm riding with Lady Luck, freeway cars and trucks,
Stars beginning to fade, and I lead the parade
Just a-wishing I'd stayed a little longer,
Oh, Lord, let me tell you that the feeling's getting stronger.

And it's six in the morning, gave me no warning; I had to be on my way.
Well there's trucks all a-passing me, and the lights are all flashing,
I'm on my way home from your place.

And now the sun's coming up, I'm riding with Lady Luck, freeway cars and trucks,
Stars beginning to fade, and I lead the parade
Just a-wishing I'd stayed a little longer,
Oh, Lord, let me tell you that the feeling's getting stronger.

And my time went so quickly, I went lickety-splickly out to my old '55
As I pulled away slowly, feeling so holy, God knows, I was feeling alive.

Now the sun's coming up, I'm riding with Lady Luck,
Freeway cars and trucks, freeway cars and trucks, freeway cars and trucks... "
2018,2018-2,"As we did not choose the people we work with before the simulation, I was feeling anxious that there may be some difficulties during the work process. Before experiencing it, the idea of the crisis simulation was threatening to me as I was thinking of the mistakes that could occur under pressure. I was concerned for one of our team members, due to his lack of communication during the preparation process, which made me feel stressed on the day before the simulation. In the beginning of the simulation I was worried and was thinking about all the possible questions I could be asked. During the first call, I organized my thoughts and started feeling calmer, which helped me to be more confident during the second call. After the simulation and the comments of the journalist, I felt more at ease. I originally felt that this experience wouldn’t be a good one, as I found that my team were not as serious as I was. I realized that the feedback after the simulation and evaluation are critical and very important for identifying positive outcomes from such experiences and could build essential skills for my future development.","Well I hope that I don't fall in love with you
'Cause falling in love just makes me blue,
Well the music plays and you display your heart for me to see,
I had a beer and now I hear you calling out for me
And I hope that I don't fall in love with you.

Well the room is crowded, people everywhere
And I wonder, should I offer you a chair?
Well if you sit down with this old clown, take that frown and break it,
Before the evening's gone away, I think that we could make it,
And I hope that I don't fall in love with you.

Well the night does funny things inside a man
These old tom-cat feelings you don't understand,
Well I turn around to look at you, you light a cigarette,
I wish I had the guts to bum one, but we've never met,
And I hope that I don't fall in love with you.

I can see that you are lonesome just like me, and it being late,
You'd like some some company,
Well I turn around to look at you, and you look back at me,
The guy you're with has up and split, the chair next to you's free,
And I hope that you don't fall in love with me.

Now it's closing time, the music's fading out
Last call for drinks, I'll have another stout.
Well I turn around to look at you, you're nowhere to be found,
I search the place for your lost face, guess I'll have another round
And I think that I just fell in love with you. "
2018,2018-3,"Prior the crisis simulation I felt motivated to do a good job with my team. I was positive minded because I knew that we were going to work efficiently together. The fact that we all share the pursuit of achieving a distinction grade, it made the commitment and hard work equal and competitive for everyone. However, my biggest concern was to not stay calm and serene dealing with the phone call complaints; specifically, going blank with the English language was my main worry. The day of the assignment I was not feeling myself due to health problems and my mind focus was not exactly like I wanted it to be. However, I tried my best in the spontaneity of the moment. Each member had their own roles but we were all working collectively to support each member if needed. I found myself trying to help everyone in every task and share my ideas about good responses to social media and press release, besides my own task. I had a good attitude to stay calm with the team and felt that I shared a good contribution to the overall development of the tasks. I made sure every member was enjoying the simulation by giving feedback, asking about how they were feeling and giving encouraging feedback via voicing that we were on track to achieving our target. Frustration at one point was felt as I noticed when conveying my message across that little attention was being paid from my colleagues. During the phone call, I felt that I started with a positive and decisive attitude but as the situation became more intense and challenging, my biggest concern occurred. I went blank a couple of times and my answers to some attacking statements were weak. I felt my English skills in that moment could not process the solid and developed responses I know I can do, but being under pressure in that situation made it more challenging. Overall, I believe multiple positives can be pointed with my team as; I managed to maintain a professional attitude, following the same steps alike to what was practiced in class simulation tasks and in the previous meetings with my team. Although I believe the feedback received from the PR practitioner was severe, I am holding a receptive attitude to improve my learning on how to adopt a serene attitude under pressure, as well as working on my communication skills; and gain incentive to become acquainted of different techniques to improve leadership skills and 'be heard'.","Well, I'm walking on down Virginia Avenue
Trying to find somebody to tell my troubles to.
Harold's club is closing, and everybody's going on home:
What's a poor boy to do?

I'll just get on back into my short, make it back to the fort
Sleep off all the crazy lizards inside of my brain.
There's got to be some place that's better than this
This life I'm leading's driving me insane

And let me tell you I'm dreaming...

Let me tell you that I'm dreaming to the twilight, this town has got me down.
I've seen all the highlights, I've been walking all around
I won't make a fuss, I'll take a Greyhound bus, carry me away from here:
Tell me, what have I got to lose?

'Cause I'm walking on down Columbus Avenue
The bars are all closing, 'cause it's quarter to two
Every town I go to is like a lock without a key
Those I leave behind are catching up on me,
Let me tell you they're catching up on me, they're catching up on me
Catching up on me, catching up on me, catching up on me. "
2018,2018-4,"The meetings before the simulation helped us a lot, indeed we felt more comfortable with each other, we also gained confidence and less stress. But during the simulation, I felt a little stressed due to the timing, I was afraid that we could not respect that, but this stress went away thanks to the group’s cohesion and our previous meetings. After that, I was very focused because we had only two hours, so I needed to be efficient. The simulation case was really interesting we had a lot to do and we did it on time, and I was very impressed because everything seemed real, the phone call, the document printed on time for each task to do and also the information broadcast one the TV, so I really felt like it was a real situation and that we have been working for the real company as a Team Manager. When the situation ended, I thought “It is already the end?”, the two hours passed very quickly, and seemed to me only few minutes and I wanted to continue it. With my team we were very satisfied with the work we provided all together and how we handle and respond to the crisis. If I had to do it again, I will do it gladly with the same group.","I'm singing this song, it's time it was sung
I've been putting it off for a while,
But it's harder by now, 'cause the truth is so clear
That I cry when I'm seeing you smile.
So goodbye, so long, the road calls me dear
And your tears cannot bind me anymore,
And farewell to the girl with the sun in her eyes
Can I kiss you, and then I'll be gone.

Every time that I tried to tell that we'd lost the magic we had at the start,
I would weep my heart when I looked in your eyes
And I searched once again for the spark.
So goodbye, so long, the road calls me dear
And your tears cannot bind me anymore,
And farewell to the girl with the sun in her eyes
Can I kiss you, and then I'll be gone.

I can see by your eyes, it's time now to go
So I'll leave you to cry in the rain,
Though I held in my hand, the key to all joy
Honey my heart was not born to be tamed.
So goodbye, so long, the road calls me dear
And your tears cannot bind me anymore,
And farewell to the girl with the sun in her eyes
Can I kiss you, and then I'll be gone.

So goodbye, so long, the road calls me dear
And your tears cannot bind me anymore,
And farewell to the girl with the sun in her eyes
Can I kiss you, and then I'll be gone.
Can I kiss you, and then I'll be gone, can I kiss you, and then I'll be gone. "

Look at two companies who are both unique (Don't use amazon.com / amazon.co.uk)
They should be an e-commerse company and use 1 technique for both companies.
e.g. PEST for both companies
Look at the service that the only companies serves, and see how their reviews reflect this.
Possibly look at the vintage sweet shop and compare it to tesco or something like that

#    Hints
# Try to identify an original theme. (direct sales vs brokers/cover the entire sales life cycle)
# If the two organistion are too similiar look for something with good rep vs bad rep
# Look for an organisation with publicly-available information. (eBay, amazon, tesco)
# Justify your decisions, why choose these organisations

# Think about what factors are likely to make you buy a product or service.
# When checking the variety of products/service available and value-for-money (asos?)
# Make sure your report makes sense, reference trust, flexibility
